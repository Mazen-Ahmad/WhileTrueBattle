  "statement": "You are given three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$. Find two positive integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x > 0$$$, $$$y > 0$$$) such that: the decimal representation of $$$x$$$ without leading zeroes consists of $$$a$$$ digits; the decimal representation of $$$y$$$ without leading zeroes consists of $$$b$$$ digits; the decimal representation of $$$gcd(x, y)$$$ without leading zeroes consists of $$$c$$$ digits. $$$gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Output $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 285$$$) — the number of testcases. Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 9$$$, $$$1 \\le c \\le min(a, b)$$$) — the required lengths of the numbers. It can be shown that the answer exists for all testcases under the given constraints. Additional constraint on the input: all testcases are different.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase print two positive integers — $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x > 0$$$, $$$y > 0$$$) such that the decimal representation of $$$x$$$ without leading zeroes consists of $$$a$$$ digits; the decimal representation of $$$y$$$ without leading zeroes consists of $$$b$$$ digits; the decimal representation of $$$gcd(x, y)$$$ without leading zeroes consists of $$$c$$$ digits.",
