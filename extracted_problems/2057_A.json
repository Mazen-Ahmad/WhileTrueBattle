  "statement": "One day, the schoolboy Mark misbehaved, so the teacher Sasha called him to the whiteboard. Sasha gave Mark a table with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. His task is to arrange the numbers $$$0, 1, \\ldots, n \\cdot m - 1$$$ in the table (each number must be used exactly once) in such a way as to maximize the sum of MEX$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ across all rows and columns. More formally, he needs to maximize $$$$$$\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \\operatorname{mex}(\\{a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\ldots, a_{i,m}\\}) + \\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{m} \\operatorname{mex}(\\{a_{1,j}, a_{2,j}, \\ldots, a_{n,j}\\}),$$$$$$ where $$$a_{i,j}$$$ is the number in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column. Sasha is not interested in how Mark arranges the numbers, so he only asks him to state one number — the maximum sum of MEX across all rows and columns that can be achieved. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$c$$$. For example: $$$\\operatorname{mex}([2,2,1])= 0$$$, since $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array. $$$\\operatorname{mex}([3,1,0,1]) = 2$$$, since $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not. $$$\\operatorname{mex}([0,3,1,2]) = 4$$$, since $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$ belong to the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of rows and columns in the table, respectively.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum possible sum of $$$\\operatorname{mex}$$$ across all rows and columns.",
