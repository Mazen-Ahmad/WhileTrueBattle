  "statement": "There are two water tanks, the first one fits $$$a$$$ liters of water, the second one fits $$$b$$$ liters of water. The first tank has $$$c$$$ ($$$0 \\le c \\le a$$$) liters of water initially, the second tank has $$$d$$$ ($$$0 \\le d \\le b$$$) liters of water initially. You want to perform $$$n$$$ operations on them. The $$$i$$$-th operation is specified by a single non-zero integer $$$v_i$$$. If $$$v_i > 0$$$, then you try to pour $$$v_i$$$ liters of water from the first tank into the second one. If $$$v_i < 0$$$, you try to pour $$$-v_i$$$ liters of water from the second tank to the first one. When you try to pour $$$x$$$ liters of water from the tank that has $$$y$$$ liters currently available to the tank that can fit $$$z$$$ more liters of water, the operation only moves $$$\\min(x, y, z)$$$ liters of water. For all pairs of the initial volumes of water $$$(c, d)$$$ such that $$$0 \\le c \\le a$$$ and $$$0 \\le d \\le b$$$, calculate the volume of water in the first tank after all operations are performed.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $$$n, a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^4$$$; $$$1 \\le a, b \\le 1000$$$) — the number of operations and the capacities of the tanks, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$$$ ($$$-1000 \\le v_i \\le 1000$$$; $$$v_i \\neq 0$$$) — the volume of water you try to pour in each operation.",
  "outputFormat": "For all pairs of the initial volumes of water $$$(c, d)$$$ such that $$$0 \\le c \\le a$$$ and $$$0 \\le d \\le b$$$, calculate the volume of water in the first tank after all operations are performed. Print $$$a + 1$$$ lines, each line should contain $$$b + 1$$$ integers. The $$$j$$$-th value in the $$$i$$$-th line should be equal to the answer for $$$c = i - 1$$$ and $$$d = j - 1$$$.",
