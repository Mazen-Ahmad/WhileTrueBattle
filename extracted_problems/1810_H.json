  "statement": "You are given a multiset $$$S$$$. Initially, $$$S = \\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n\\}$$$. You will perform the following operation $$$n-1$$$ times. Choose the largest number $$$S_{\\text{max}}$$$ in $$$S$$$ and the smallest number $$$S_{\\text{min}}$$$ in $$$S$$$. Remove the two numbers from $$$S$$$, and add $$$S_{\\text{max}} - S_{\\text{min}}$$$ into $$$S$$$. It's easy to show that there will be exactly one number left after $$$n-1$$$ operations. Output that number.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Their description follows. For each test case, one single line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$) — the initial size of the multiset $$$S$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output an integer denoting the only number left after $$$n-1$$$ operations.",
