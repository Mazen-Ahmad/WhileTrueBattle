  "statement": "Suneet has three digits $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$. Since math isn't his strongest point, he asks you to determine if you can choose any two digits to make a sum greater or equal to $$$10$$$. Output \" YES \" if there is such a pair, and \" NO \" otherwise.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains three digits $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a, b, c \\leq 9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" YES \" if such a pair exists, and \" NO \" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \" and \" YES \" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
