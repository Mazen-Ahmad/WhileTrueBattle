  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$x$$$. You need to find the smallest non-negative integer $$$y$$$ such that the numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ share at least one common digit. In other words, there must exist a decimal digit $$$d$$$ that appears in both the representation of the number $$$x$$$ and the number $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le 1000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer $$$y$$$ — the minimum non-negative number that satisfies the condition.",
