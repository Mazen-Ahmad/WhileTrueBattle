  "statement": "You have an array of integers (initially empty). You have to perform $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is of one of two types: \"$$$1$$$ $$$x$$$\" — add the element $$$x$$$ to the end of the array; \"$$$2$$$ $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$\" — replace all occurrences of $$$x$$$ in the array with $$$y$$$. Find the resulting array after performing all the queries.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. Next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries (one per line). Each query is of one of two types: \"$$$1$$$ $$$x$$$\" ($$$1 \\le x \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$); \"$$$2$$$ $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$\" ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$). It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the first type.",
  "outputFormat": "In a single line, print $$$k$$$ integers — the resulting array after performing all the queries, where $$$k$$$ is the number of queries of the first type.",
