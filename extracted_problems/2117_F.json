  "statement": "Yousef has a rooted tree$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ vertices, which is rooted at vertex $$$1$$$. You would like to give Yousef an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where each $$$a_i$$$ $$$(1 \\le i \\le n)$$$ can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$ . Let $$$s_u$$$ denote the sum of $$$a_v$$$ where vertex $$$v$$$ is in the subtree$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ of vertex $$$u$$$. Yousef considers the tree special if all the values in $$$s$$$ are pairwise distinct (i.e., all subtree sums are unique). Your task is to help Yousef count the number of different arrays $$$a$$$ that result in the tree being special . Two arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are different if there exists an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$b_i \\neq c_i$$$. As the result can be very large, you should print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A tree is a connected undirected graph with $$$n - 1$$$ edges. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$The subtree of a vertex $$$v$$$ is the set of all vertices that pass through $$$v$$$ on a simple path to the root. Note that vertex $$$v$$$ is also included in the set.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\le t \\le 10^4)$$$ — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of several lines. The first line of the test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$$$ — the number of vertices in the tree. Then $$$n−1$$$ lines follow, each of them contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ $$$(1 \\le u,v \\le n, u \\ne v)$$$ which describe a pair of vertices connected by an edge. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree and has no loops or multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer $$$x$$$ — the number of different arrays $$$a$$$ that result in the tree being special , modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
