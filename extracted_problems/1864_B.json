  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer $$$k$$$. In one step you can perform any one of the two operations below: Pick an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n - 2$$$) and swap $$$s_{i}$$$ and $$$s_{i+2}$$$. Pick an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n-k+1$$$) and reverse the order of letters formed by the range $$$[i,i+k-1]$$$ of the string. Formally, if the string currently is equal to $$$s_1\\ldots s_{i-1}s_is_{i+1}\\ldots s_{i+k-2}s_{i+k-1}s_{i+k}\\ldots s_{n-1}s_n$$$, change it to $$$s_1\\ldots s_{i-1}s_{i+k-1}s_{i+k-2}\\ldots s_{i+1}s_is_{i+k}\\ldots s_{n-1}s_n$$$. You can make as many steps as you want (possibly, zero). Your task is to find the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain after some number of steps. A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ of the same length if and only if the following holds: in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k < n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the lexicographically smallest string after doing some (possibly, zero) steps.",
