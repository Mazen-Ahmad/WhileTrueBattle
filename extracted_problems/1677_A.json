  "statement": "Tokitsukaze has a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Recall that a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is a sequence $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers, each of which from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$). She wants to know how many different indices tuples $$$[a,b,c,d]$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a < b < c < d \\leq n$$$) in this permutation satisfy the following two inequalities: $$$p_a < p_c$$$ and $$$p_b > p_d$$$. Note that two tuples $$$[a_1,b_1,c_1,d_1]$$$ and $$$[a_2,b_2,c_2,d_2]$$$ are considered to be different if $$$a_1 \\ne a_2$$$ or $$$b_1 \\ne b_2$$$ or $$$c_1 \\ne c_2$$$ or $$$d_1 \\ne d_2$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\leq n \\leq 5000$$$) — the length of permutation $$$p$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the number of different $$$[a,b,c,d]$$$ tuples.",
