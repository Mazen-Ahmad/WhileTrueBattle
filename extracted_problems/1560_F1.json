  "statement": "It is a simplified version of problem F2. The difference between them is the constraints (F1: $$$k \\le 2$$$, F2: $$$k \\le 10$$$). You are given an integer $$$n$$$. Find the minimum integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$x \\ge n$$$ and the number $$$x$$$ is $$$k$$$- beautiful . A number is called $$$k$$$- beautiful if its decimal representation having no leading zeroes contains no more than $$$k$$$ different digits. E.g. if $$$k = 2$$$, the numbers $$$3434443$$$, $$$55550$$$, $$$777$$$ and $$$21$$$ are $$$k$$$- beautiful whereas the numbers $$$120$$$, $$$445435$$$ and $$$998244353$$$ are not.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 2$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output on a separate line $$$x$$$ — the minimum $$$k$$$- beautiful integer such that $$$x \\ge n$$$.",
