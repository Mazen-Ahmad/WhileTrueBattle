  "statement": "You just created a new character in your favourite role-playing game and now have to decide how to skill him. The two skill attributes to be chosen are: damage per hit and hits per second . Damage per hit is the amount of damage you deal with a single hit, while hits per second is the number of hits you can make in one second. Initially, both skill attributes are set at $$$0$$$. You have $$$k$$$ skill points to distribute as you want; in other words, you can choose the values of the two skills so that they are positive integers with sum at most $$$k$$$. The tutorial of the game (the boring part you want to finish as soon as possible) consists of $$$n$$$ monsters to be killed one after the other. The $$$i$$$-th monster has $$$h_i$$$ health points, i.e., it dies after you have inflicted at least $$$h_i$$$ damage. How can you assign the two skill attributes to minimize the time necessary to kill all the $$$n$$$ monsters?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq200\\,000$$$, $$$2\\leq k\\leq200\\,000$$$) — the number of enemies and the number of skill points. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_i$$$ ($$$1\\leq h_i\\leq10^{13}$$$) — the health of the $$$i$$$th enemy.",
  "outputFormat": "Print two positive integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1\\le x, y$$$ and $$$x+y\\le k$$$) — the number of skill points you want to invest in damage per hit and hits per second. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.",
