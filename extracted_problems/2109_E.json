  "statement": "Mouf is bored with themes, so he decided not to use any themes for this problem. You are given a binary$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You are to perform the following operation exactly $$$k$$$ times: select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) such that $$$s_i = \\mathtt{0}$$$; then flip$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ each $$$s_j$$$ for all indices $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j \\le i$$$). You need to count the number of possible ways to perform all $$$k$$$ operations. Since the answer could be ginormous, print it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Two sequences of operations are considered different if they differ in the index selected at any step. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A binary string is a string that consists only of the characters $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$Flipping a binary character is changing it from $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ to $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ or vice versa.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 500$$$) — the length of the binary string $$$s$$$ and the number of times the operation must be performed, respectively. The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of only characters $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$500$$$ over all test cases.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of ways you can perform exactly $$$k$$$ operations, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
