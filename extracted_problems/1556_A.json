  "statement": "William has two numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ initially both equal to zero . William mastered performing three different operations with them quickly. Before performing each operation some positive integer $$$k$$$ is picked, which is then used to perform one of the following operations: (note, that for each operation you can choose a new positive integer $$$k$$$) add number $$$k$$$ to both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, or add number $$$k$$$ to $$$a$$$ and subtract $$$k$$$ from $$$b$$$, or add number $$$k$$$ to $$$b$$$ and subtract $$$k$$$ from $$$a$$$. Note that after performing operations, numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ may become negative as well. William wants to find out the minimal number of operations he would have to perform to make $$$a$$$ equal to his favorite number $$$c$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal to his second favorite number $$$d$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ $$$(0 \\le c, d \\le 10^9)$$$, which are William's favorite numbers and which he wants $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ to be transformed into.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output a single number, which is the minimal number of operations which William would have to perform to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$c$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal to $$$d$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to achieve this using the described operations.",
