  "statement": "You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Please find an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ that is perfect. A perfect array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ satisfies the following criteria: $$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. $$$a_i$$$ is divisible by $$$i$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n$$$ is divisible by $$$n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 200$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 200$$$) â€” the length of the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ that is perfect. We can show that an answer always exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.",
