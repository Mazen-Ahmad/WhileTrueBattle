  "statement": "Consider a rooted undirected tree. Each vertex can be colored blue, green, or yellow. A coloring is called beautiful if it meets these conditions: the root of the tree is green; if you consider all blue and green vertices , they are reachable from each other without passing through any yellow vertices; if you consider all yellow and green vertices , they are reachable from each other without passing through any blue vertices; You are given an integer $$$m$$$. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of vertices in a tree with exactly $$$m$$$ beautiful colorings.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of vertices in a tree with exactly $$$m$$$ beautiful colorings. If such a tree does not exist, print $$$-1$$$.",
