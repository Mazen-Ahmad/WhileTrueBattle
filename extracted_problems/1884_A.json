  "statement": "A positive integer is called $$$k$$$-beautiful, if the digit sum of the decimal representation of this number is divisible by $$$k^{\\dagger}$$$. For example, $$$9272$$$ is $$$5$$$-beautiful, since the digit sum of $$$9272$$$ is $$$9 + 2 + 7 + 2 = 20$$$. You are given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$. Please find the smallest integer $$$y \\ge x$$$ which is $$$k$$$-beautiful. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$ An integer $$$n$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$ if there exists an integer $$$m$$$ such that $$$n = k \\cdot m$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 10$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the smallest integer $$$y \\ge x$$$ which is $$$k$$$-beautiful.",
