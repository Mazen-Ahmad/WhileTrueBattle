  "statement": "The numbers $$$1, \\, 2, \\, \\dots, \\, n \\cdot k$$$ are colored with $$$n$$$ colors. These colors are indexed by $$$1, \\, 2, \\, \\dots, \\, n$$$. For each $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, there are exactly $$$k$$$ numbers colored with color $$$i$$$. Let $$$[a, \\, b]$$$ denote the interval of integers between $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ inclusive, that is, the set $$$\\{a, \\, a + 1, \\, \\dots, \\, b\\}$$$. You must choose $$$n$$$ intervals $$$[a_1, \\, b_1], \\, [a_2, \\, b_2], \\, \\dots, [a_n, \\, b_n]$$$ such that: for each $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, it holds $$$1 \\le a_i < b_i \\le n \\cdot k$$$; for each $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, the numbers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ are colored with color $$$i$$$; each number $$$1 \\le x \\le n \\cdot k$$$ belongs to at most $$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{k - 1} \\right\\rceil$$$ intervals. One can show that such a family of intervals always exists under the given constraints.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$, $$$2 \\le k \\le 100$$$) â€” the number of colors and the number of occurrences of each color. The second line contains $$$n \\cdot k$$$ integers $$$c_1, \\, c_2, \\, \\dots, \\, c_{nk}$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_j \\le n$$$), where $$$c_j$$$ is the color of number $$$j$$$. It is guaranteed that, for each $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, it holds $$$c_j = i$$$ for exactly $$$k$$$ distinct indices $$$j$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$n$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain the two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. If there are multiple valid choices of the intervals, output any.",
