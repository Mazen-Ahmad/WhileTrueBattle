  "statement": "You are given two arrays of integers: $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$. You need to determine if it is possible to transform array $$$a$$$ into array $$$b$$$ using the following operation several (possibly, zero) times. Among all non-empty subarrays$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$a$$$, choose any with the maximum sum, and replace this subarray with an arbitrary non-empty integer array. If it is possible, you need to construct any possible sequence of operations. Constraint: in your answer, the sum of the lengths of the arrays used as replacements must not exceed $$$n + m$$$ across all operations. The numbers must not exceed $$$10^9$$$ in absolute value. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$a$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 200$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 500$$$) — the lengths of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\le b_i \\le 10^6$$$) — the elements of array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to transform array $$$a$$$ into array $$$b$$$. Otherwise, in the first line, output the number of operations $$$0 \\leq q \\leq n + m$$$. Then output the operations in the following format in the order they are performed. In the first line of each operation, print three numbers $$$l, r, k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq |a|$$$). In the second line, print $$$k$$$ integers $$$c_1 \\ldots c_k$$$, which means replacing the segment $$$a_l, \\ldots, a_r$$$ with the array $$$c_1, \\ldots, c_k$$$. The sum of $$$k$$$ across all $$$q$$$ operations must not exceed $$$n + m$$$. Additionally, it must hold that $$$-10^9 \\leq c_i \\leq 10^9$$$. You do not need to minimize the number of operations.",
