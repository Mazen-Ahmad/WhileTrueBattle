  "statement": "You are given an $$$n \\times n$$$ multiplication table and a positive integer $$$m = m_1 \\cdot m_2$$$. A $$$n \\times n$$$ multiplication table is a table with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, where $$$a_{i, j} = i \\cdot j$$$. For each divisor $$$d$$$ of $$$m$$$, check: does $$$d$$$ occur in the table at least once, and if it does, what is the minimum row that contains $$$d$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10$$$) — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m_1$$$ and $$$m_2$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\le m_1, m_2 \\le 10^9$$$) — the size of the multiplication table and the integer $$$m$$$ represented as $$$m_1 \\cdot m_2$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, let $$$d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_k$$$ be all divisors of $$$m$$$ sorted in the increasing order. And let $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$ be an array of answers, where $$$a_i$$$ is equal to the minimum row index where divisor $$$d_i$$$ occurs, or $$$0$$$, if there is no such row. Since array $$$a$$$ may be large, first, print an integer $$$s$$$ — the number of divisors of $$$m$$$ that are present in the $$$n \\times n$$$ table. Next, print a single value $$$X = a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_k$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation .",
