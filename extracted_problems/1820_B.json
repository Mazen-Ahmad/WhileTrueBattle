  "statement": "Did you think there was going to be a JoJo legend here? But no, that was me, Dio! Given a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters 0 and 1 . Let's build a square table of size $$$n \\times n$$$, consisting of 0 and 1 characters as follows. In the first row of the table write the original string $$$s$$$. In the second row of the table write cyclic shift of the string $$$s$$$ by one to the right. In the third row of the table, write the cyclic shift of line $$$s$$$ by two to the right. And so on. Thus, the row with number $$$k$$$ will contain a cyclic shift of string $$$s$$$ by $$$k$$$ to the right. The rows are numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$ top-to-bottom . In the resulting table we need to find the rectangle consisting only of ones that has the largest area. We call a rectangle the set of all cells $$$(i, j)$$$ in the table, such that $$$x_1 \\le i \\le x_2$$$ and $$$y_1 \\le j \\le y_2$$$ for some integers $$$0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 < n$$$ and $$$0 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 < n$$$. Recall that the cyclic shift of string $$$s$$$ by $$$k$$$ to the right is the string $$$s_{n-k+1} \\ldots s_n s_1 s_2 \\ldots s_{n-k}$$$. For example, the cyclic shift of the string \" 01011 \" by $$$0$$$ to the right is the string itself \" 01011 \", its cyclic shift by $$$3$$$ to the right is the string \" 01101 \".",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first and the only line of each test case contains a single binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le \\lvert s \\rvert \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), consisting of characters 0 and 1 . It is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum area of a rectangle consisting only of ones. If there is no such rectangle, output $$$0$$$.",
