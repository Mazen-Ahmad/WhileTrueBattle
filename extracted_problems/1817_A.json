  "statement": "A sequence is almost-increasing if it does not contain three consecutive elements $$$x, y, z$$$ such that $$$x\\ge y\\ge z$$$. You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries. Each query consists of two integers $$$1\\le l\\le r\\le n$$$. For each query, find the length of the longest almost-increasing subsequence of the subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r$$$. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, q \\leq 200\\,000$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the values of the array $$$a$$$. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains the description of a query. Each line contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$) — the query is about the subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each of the $$$q$$$ queries, print a line containing the length of the longest almost-increasing subsequence of the subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r$$$.",
