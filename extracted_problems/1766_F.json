  "statement": "You are given a graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ directed arcs. The $$$i$$$-th arc goes from the vertex $$$x_i$$$ to the vertex $$$y_i$$$, has capacity $$$c_i$$$ and weight $$$w_i$$$. No arc goes into the vertex $$$1$$$, and no arc goes from the vertex $$$n$$$. There are no cycles of negative weight in the graph (it is impossible to travel from any vertex to itself in such a way that the total weight of all arcs you go through is negative). You have to assign each arc a flow (an integer between $$$0$$$ and its capacity, inclusive). For every vertex except $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ , the total flow on the arcs going to this vertex must be equal to the total flow on the arcs going from that vertex. Let the flow on the $$$i$$$-th arc be $$$f_i$$$, then the cost of the flow is equal to $$$\\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{m} f_i w_i$$$. You have to find a flow which minimizes the cost. Sounds classical, right? Well, we have some additional constraints on the flow on every edge: if $$$c_i$$$ is even, $$$f_i$$$ must be even; if $$$c_i$$$ is odd, $$$f_i$$$ must be odd. Can you solve this problem?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le 200$$$). Then $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains four integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$, and $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le n - 1$$$; $$$2 \\le y_i \\le n$$$; $$$x_i \\ne y_i$$$; $$$1 \\le c_i \\le 100$$$; $$$-100 \\le w_i \\le 100$$$). These integers describe the $$$i$$$-th arc. Additional constraints on the input: there are no negative cycles in the graph.",
  "outputFormat": "If a flow satisfying all of the constraints does not exist, print Impossible . Otherwise, print two lines: the first line should contain one word Possible ; the second line should contain $$$m$$$ integers $$$f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_m$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. Note that the cost of the flow should be minimized.",
