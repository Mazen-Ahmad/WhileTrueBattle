  "statement": "There are balls of $$$n$$$ different colors; the number of balls of the $$$i$$$-th color is $$$a_i$$$. The balls can be combined into groups. Each group should contain at most $$$2$$$ balls, and no more than $$$1$$$ ball of each color. Consider all $$$2^n$$$ sets of colors. For a set of colors, let's denote its value as the minimum number of groups the balls of those colors can be distributed into. For example, if there are three colors with $$$3$$$, $$$1$$$ and $$$7$$$ balls respectively, they can be combined into $$$7$$$ groups (and not less than $$$7$$$), so the value of that set of colors is $$$7$$$. Your task is to calculate the sum of values over all $$$2^n$$$ possible sets of colors. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5000$$$) — the number of colors. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 5000$$$) — the number of balls of the $$$i$$$-th color. Additional constraint on input: the total number of balls doesn't exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer — the sum of values of all $$$2^n$$$ sets of colors, taken modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
