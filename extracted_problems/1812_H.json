  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. There is an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers hidden from you. Your task is to find the smallest element of the array. To do this, you can ask several queries. In each query, you can pick two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$). In return, you will be given the value of $$$\\max(a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r)$$$. In other words, you will be told the maximum value of the subarray from $$$a_l$$$ to $$$a_r$$$. Find the minimum of the array. You can ask at most $$$\\mathbf{624}$$$ queries. It is guaranteed that the values $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ are chosen uniformly at random between $$$0$$$ and $$$2^{32}-1$$$ (inclusive).",
