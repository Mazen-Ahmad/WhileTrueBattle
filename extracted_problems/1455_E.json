  "statement": "You are given four different integer points $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, $$$p_3$$$ and $$$p_4$$$ on $$$\\mathit{XY}$$$ grid. In one step you can choose one of the points $$$p_i$$$ and move it in one of four directions by one. In other words, if you have chosen point $$$p_i = (x, y)$$$ you can move it to $$$(x, y + 1)$$$, $$$(x, y - 1)$$$, $$$(x + 1, y)$$$ or $$$(x - 1, y)$$$. Your goal to move points in such a way that they will form a square with sides parallel to $$$\\mathit{OX}$$$ and $$$\\mathit{OY}$$$ axes (a square with side $$$0$$$ is allowed). What is the minimum number of steps you need to make such a square?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. Each line contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$0 \\le x, y \\le 10^9$$$) — coordinates of one of the points $$$p_i = (x, y)$$$. All points are different in one test case.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum number of steps to make a square.",
