  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. You found the numbers $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$ in the attic, but lost two arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$. You remember that: $$$|A| + |B| = n$$$, the total length of the arrays is $$$n$$$. $$$|A| \\geq k$$$ and $$$|B| \\geq k$$$, the length of each array is at least $$$k$$$. The arrays consist only of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$. If you take any $$$k$$$ consecutive elements from array $$$A$$$, they will all be different. Also, if you take any $$$k$$$ consecutive elements from array $$$B$$$, they will all be different. Fortunately, a kind spirit that settled in the attic found these arrays and concatenated them into an array $$$C$$$ of length $$$n$$$. That is, the elements of array $$$A$$$ were first written into array $$$C$$$, followed by the elements of array $$$B$$$. You can ask the kind spirit up to $$$250$$$ questions. Each question contains an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$). In response, you will receive the $$$i$$$-th element of the concatenated array $$$C$$$. You need to find the lengths of arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$, or report that it is impossible to determine them uniquely.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 300$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq 50$$$, $$$2 k \\leq n \\leq 10^{6}$$$). Note that the sum of $$$n$$$ across test cases is not limited .",
