  "statement": "Timur loves codeforces. That's why he has a string $$$s$$$ having length $$$10$$$ made containing only lowercase Latin letters. Timur wants to know how many indices string $$$s$$$ differs from the string \" codeforces \". For example string $$$s =$$$ \" co ol for s e z \" differs from \" codeforces \" in $$$4$$$ indices, shown in bold. Help Timur by finding the number of indices where string $$$s$$$ differs from \" codeforces \". Note that you can't reorder the characters in the string $$$s$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case is one line and contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of exactly $$$10$$$ lowercase Latin characters.",
