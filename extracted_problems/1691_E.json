  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ colored segments on the number line. Each segment is either colored red or blue. The $$$i$$$-th segment can be represented by a tuple $$$(c_i, l_i, r_i)$$$. The segment contains all the points in the range $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$, inclusive, and its color denoted by $$$c_i$$$: if $$$c_i = 0$$$, it is a red segment; if $$$c_i = 1$$$, it is a blue segment. We say that two segments of different colors are connected , if they share at least one common point. Two segments belong to the same group, if they are either connected directly, or through a sequence of directly connected segments. Find the number of groups of segments.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of segments. Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$c_i, l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq c_i \\leq 1, 0 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq 10^9$$$), describing the $$$i$$$-th segment. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer $$$k$$$, the number of groups of segments.",
