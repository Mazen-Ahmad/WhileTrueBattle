  "statement": "The longest non-decreasing subsequence of an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the longest sequence of indices $$$1 \\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k \\leq n$$$ such that $$$a_{i_1} \\leq a_{i_2} \\leq \\ldots \\leq a_{i_k}$$$. The length of the sequence is defined as the number of elements in the sequence. For example, the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the array $$$a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 2]$$$ is $$$3$$$. You are given two arrays of integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_n$$$ and $$$r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n$$$. For each $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$, solve the following problem: Consider all arrays of integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$, such that for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq k$$$, it holds that $$$l_i \\leq a_i \\leq r_i$$$. Find the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence among all such arrays.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the arrays $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. The next $$$n$$$ lines of each test case contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers: for each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, output the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence among all suitable arrays.",
