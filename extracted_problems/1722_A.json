  "statement": "Timur likes his name. As a spelling of his name, he allows any permutation of the letters of the name. For example, the following strings are valid spellings of his name: Timur , miurT , Trumi , mriTu . Note that the correct spelling must have uppercased T and lowercased other letters. Today he wrote string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of uppercase or lowercase Latin letters. He asks you to check if $$$s$$$ is the correct spelling of his name.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n \\leq 10)$$$ — the length of string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting of only uppercase or lowercase Latin characters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" YES \" (without quotes) if $$$s$$$ satisfies the condition, and \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \" and \" YES \" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
