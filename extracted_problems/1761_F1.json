  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $$$n$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved. Let's call an array $$$a$$$ of odd length $$$2m+1$$$ (with $$$m \\ge 1$$$) bad , if element $$$a_{m+1}$$$ is equal to the median of this array. In other words, the array is bad if, after sorting it, the element at $$$m+1$$$-st position remains the same. Let's call a permutation $$$p$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ anti-median , if every its subarray of odd length $$$\\ge 3$$$ is not bad. You are already given values of some elements of the permutation. Find the number of ways to set unknown values to obtain an anti-median permutation. As this number can be very large, find it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \\le n \\le 1000)$$$ — the length of the permutation. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$, or $$$p_i = -1$$$) — the elements of the permutation. If $$$p_i \\neq -1$$$, it's given, else it's unknown. It's guaranteed that if for some $$$i \\neq j$$$ holds $$$p_i \\neq -1, p_j \\neq -1$$$, then $$$p_i \\neq p_j$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of ways to set unknown values to obtain an anti-median permutation, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
