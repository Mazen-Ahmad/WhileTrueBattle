  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ along with a string $$$s$$$. Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length $$$n$$$ that can be formed using the first $$$k$$$ lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of $$$s$$$. If the answer is NO , you also need to print a string of length $$$n$$$ that can be formed using the first $$$k$$$ lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of $$$s$$$. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them. Note: A string $$$a$$$ is called a subsequence of another string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from $$$b$$$ without changing the order of the remaining characters.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t \\, (1 \\le t \\le 10^5)$$$, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains $$$3$$$ integers $$$n \\, (1 \\le n \\le 26), \\: k \\, (1 \\le k \\le 26), \\: m \\, (1 \\le m \\le 1000)$$$, where $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ are the same as described in the input and $$$m$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ of length $$$m$$$, comprising only of the first $$$k$$$ lowercase English alphabets. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ and the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length $$$n$$$ that can be formed using the first $$$k$$$ lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of $$$s$$$, else print NO . If your answer is NO , print a string of length $$$n$$$ that can be formed using the first $$$k$$$ lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of $$$s$$$ in the next line. You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES , yES , YeS will all be recognized as a positive answer).",
