  "statement": "You are given two integer numbers, $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$. You may perform several operations with the integer $$$x$$$. Each operation you perform is the following one: choose any digit $$$y$$$ that occurs in the decimal representation of $$$x$$$ at least once, and replace $$$x$$$ by $$$x \\cdot y$$$. You want to make the length of decimal representation of $$$x$$$ (without leading zeroes) equal to $$$n$$$. What is the minimum number of operations required to do that?",
  "inputFormat": "The only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 19$$$; $$$1 \\le x < 10^{n-1}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer â€” the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of $$$x$$$ (without leading zeroes) equal to $$$n$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.",
