  "statement": "Given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Find three distinct positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ such that $$$a + b + c = n$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b) = c$$$, where $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$10 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output three distinct positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ satisfying the requirements. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any. We can show that an answer always exists.",
