  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. You have to use flush operation right after printing each line. For example, in C++ you should use the function fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() , in Java or Kotlin — System.out.flush() , and in Python — sys.stdout.flush() . The jury has a string $$$s$$$ consisting of characters 0 and/or 1 . The length of this string is $$$n$$$. You can ask the following queries: $$$1$$$ $$$t$$$ — \"how many times does $$$t$$$ appear in $$$s$$$ as a contiguous substring?\" Here, $$$t$$$ should be a string consisting of characters 0 and/or 1 ; its length should be at least $$$1$$$ and at most $$$n$$$. For example, if the string $$$s$$$ is 111011 and the string $$$t$$$ is 11 , the response to the query is $$$3$$$. You have to guess at least one character in the string $$$s$$$ by asking no more than $$$3$$$ queries. Note that giving the answer does not count as a query. In every test and in every test case, the string $$$s$$$ is fixed beforehand .",
