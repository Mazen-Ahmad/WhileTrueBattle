  "statement": "You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. A pair of integers $$$(i, j)$$$, such that $$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$, is called good , if there does not exist an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) such that $$$a_i$$$ is divisible by $$$a_k$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ is divisible by $$$a_k$$$ at the same time. Please, find the number of good pairs.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
