  "statement": "Sasha has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. He got bored and for all $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$i < j$$$), he wrote down the minimum value of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$. He obtained a new array $$$b$$$ of size $$$\\frac{n\\cdot (n-1)}{2}$$$. For example, if $$$a=$$$ [$$$2,3,5,1$$$], he would write [$$$\\min(2, 3), \\min(2, 5), \\min(2, 1), \\min(3, 5), \\min(3, 1), min(5, 1)$$$] $$$=$$$ [$$$2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1$$$]. Then, he randomly shuffled all the elements of the array $$$b$$$. Unfortunately, he forgot the array $$$a$$$, and your task is to restore any possible array $$$a$$$ from which the array $$$b$$$ could have been obtained. The elements of array $$$a$$$ should be in the range $$$[-10^9,10^9]$$$ .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 200$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 10^3$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$\\frac{n\\cdot (n-1)}{2}$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,\\dots,b_{\\frac{n\\cdot (n-1)}{2}}$$$ ($$$−10^9\\le b_i\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all tests does not exceed $$$10^3$$$ and for each array $$$b$$$ in the test, there exists an original array.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output any possible array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.",
