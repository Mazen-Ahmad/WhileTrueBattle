  "statement": "You have a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$. You also have a string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$m$$$ characters B . You are going to perform the following $$$n$$$ operations. At the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) operation, you replace either the $$$a_i$$$-th or the $$$(m + 1 - a_i)$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ with A . You can replace the character at any position multiple times through the operations. Find the lexicographically smallest string you can get after these operations. A string $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$y$$$ of the same length if and only if in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, the string $$$x$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$). The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 50$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$a$$$ and the length of the string $$$s$$$ respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le m$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a string of length $$$m$$$ — the lexicographically smallest string you can get. Each character of the string should be either capital English letter A or capital English letter B .",
