  "statement": "You are given a matrix $$$a$$$ consisting of positive integers. It has $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. Construct a matrix $$$b$$$ consisting of positive integers. It should have the same size as $$$a$$$, and the following conditions should be met: $$$1 \\le b_{i,j} \\le 10^6$$$; $$$b_{i,j}$$$ is a multiple of $$$a_{i,j}$$$; the absolute value of the difference between numbers in any adjacent pair of cells (two cells that share the same side) in $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$k^4$$$ for some integer $$$k \\ge 1$$$ ($$$k$$$ is not necessarily the same for all pairs, it is own for each pair). We can show that the answer always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n,m \\le 500$$$). Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers. The $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line is $$$a_{i,j}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{i,j} \\le 16$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "The output should contain $$$n$$$ lines each containing $$$m$$$ integers. The $$$j$$$-th integer in the $$$i$$$-th line should be $$$b_{i,j}$$$.",
