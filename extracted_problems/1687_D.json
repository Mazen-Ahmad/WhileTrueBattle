  "statement": "Ran is especially skilled in computation and mathematics. It is said that she can do unimaginable calculation work in an instant. — Perfect Memento in Strict Sense Ran Yakumo is a cute girl who loves creating cute Maths problems. Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the minimal square number strictly greater than $$$x$$$, and $$$g(x)$$$ be the maximal square number less than or equal to $$$x$$$. For example, $$$f(1)=f(2)=g(4)=g(8)=4$$$. A positive integer $$$x$$$ is cute if $$$x-g(x)<f(x)-x$$$. For example, $$$1,5,11$$$ are cute integers, while $$$3,8,15$$$ are not. Ran gives you an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. She wants you to find the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$a_i + k$$$ is a cute number for any element of $$$a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ intergers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq a_n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^6$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single interger $$$k$$$ — the answer.",
