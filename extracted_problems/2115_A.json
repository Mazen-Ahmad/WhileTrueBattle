  "statement": "Gellyfish hates math problems, but she has to finish her math homework: Gellyfish is given an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. She needs to do the following two-step operation until all elements of $$$a$$$ are equal: Select two indexes $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ satisfying $$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$ and $$$i \\neq j$$$. Replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\gcd(a_i, a_j)$$$. Now, Gellyfish asks you for the minimum number of operations to achieve her goal. It can be proven that Gellyfish can always achieve her goal.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5000$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 5000$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
