  "statement": "Given $$$n$$$ strings, each of length $$$2$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from ' a ' to ' k ', output the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and the $$$i$$$-th string and the $$$j$$$-th string differ in exactly one position. In other words, count the number of pairs $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$i < j$$$) such that the $$$i$$$-th string and the $$$j$$$-th string have exactly one position $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p \\leq 2$$$) such that $$${s_{i}}_{p} \\neq {s_{j}}_{p}$$$. The answer may not fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use 64-bit integers like long long in C++ to avoid integer overflow.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of strings. Then follows $$$n$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which containing a single string $$$s_i$$$ of length $$$2$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters from ' a ' to ' k ' . It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the number of pairs $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$i < j$$$) such that the $$$i$$$-th string and the $$$j$$$-th string have exactly one position $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p \\leq 2$$$) such that $$${s_{i}}_{p} \\neq {s_{j}}_{p}$$$. Please note, that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).",
