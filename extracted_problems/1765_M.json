  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$. Your task is to find two positive (greater than $$$0$$$) integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that $$$a+b=n$$$ and the least common multiple (LCM) of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is the minimum among all possible values of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ — the answer to the problem. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.",
