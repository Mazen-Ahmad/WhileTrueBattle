  "statement": "Matthew is given two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$3$$$. He thinks it's particularly funny to create two new words by swapping the first character of $$$a$$$ with the first character of $$$b$$$. He wants you to output $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ after the swap. Note that the new words may not necessarily be different.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$3$$$. The strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, after the swap, output $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, separated by a space.",
