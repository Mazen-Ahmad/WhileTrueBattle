  "statement": "Two segments $$$[l_1, r_1]$$$ and $$$[l_2, r_2]$$$ intersect if there exists at least one $$$x$$$ such that $$$l_1 \\le x \\le r_1$$$ and $$$l_2 \\le x \\le r_2$$$. An array of segments $$$[[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\dots, [l_k, r_k]]$$$ is called beautiful if $$$k$$$ is even, and is possible to split the elements of this array into $$$\\frac{k}{2}$$$ pairs in such a way that: every element of the array belongs to exactly one of the pairs; segments in each pair intersect with each other; segments in different pairs do not intersect. For example, the array $$$[[2, 4], [9, 12], [2, 4], [7, 7], [10, 13], [6, 8]]$$$ is beautiful, since it is possible to form $$$3$$$ pairs as follows: the first element of the array (segment $$$[2, 4]$$$) and the third element of the array (segment $$$[2, 4]$$$); the second element of the array (segment $$$[9, 12]$$$) and the fifth element of the array (segment $$$[10, 13]$$$); the fourth element of the array (segment $$$[7, 7]$$$) and the sixth element of the array (segment $$$[6, 8]$$$). As you can see, the segments in each pair intersect, and no segments from different pairs intersect. You are given an array of $$$n$$$ segments $$$[[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\dots, [l_n, r_n]]$$$. You have to remove the minimum possible number of elements from this array so that the resulting array is beautiful.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of segments in the array. Then, $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 10^9$$$) denoting the $$$i$$$-th segment. Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of elements you have to remove so that the resulting array is beautiful.",
