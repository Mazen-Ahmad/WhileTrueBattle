  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. In one operation, you will perform the following two-step move: Choose an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\le x \\le 10^{9}$$$). Replace each $$$a_i$$$ with $$$|a_i - x|$$$, where $$$|v|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$v$$$. For example, by choosing $$$x = 8$$$, the array $$$[5, 7, 10]$$$ will be changed into $$$[|5-8|, |7-8|, |10-8|] = [3,1,2]$$$. Construct a sequence of operations to make all elements of $$$a$$$ equal to $$$0$$$ in at most $$$40$$$ operations or determine that it is impossible. You do not need to minimize the number of operations.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to make all array elements equal to $$$0$$$ in at most $$$40$$$ operations. Otherwise, output two lines. The first line of output should contain a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le 40$$$) — the number of operations. The second line of output should contain $$$k$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k$$$ ($$$0 \\le x_i \\le 10^{9}$$$) — the sequence of operations, denoting that on the $$$i$$$-th operation, you chose $$$x=x_i$$$. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them. You do not need to minimize the number of operations.",
