  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. Remember to flush your output while communicating with the testing program. You may use fflush(stdout) in C++, system.out.flush() in Java, stdout.flush() in Python or flush(output) in Pascal to flush the output. If you use some other programming language, consult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive problems: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307 . The jury has chosen a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters; each character of $$$s$$$ is a lowercase Latin letter. Your task is to guess this string; initially, you know only its length. You may ask queries of two types: $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ — the query of the first type, where $$$i$$$ is an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. In response to this query, the jury will tell you the character $$$s_i$$$; $$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ — the query of the second type, where $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ are integers such that $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$. In response to this query, the jury will tell you the number of different characters among $$$s_l, s_{l+1}, \\dots, s_r$$$. You are allowed to ask no more than $$$26$$$ queries of the first type, and no more than $$$6000$$$ queries of the second type. Your task is to restore the string $$$s$$$. For each test in this problem, the string $$$s$$$ is fixed beforehand, and will be the same for every submission.",
  "inputFormat": "Initially, the jury program sends one integer $$$n$$$ on a separate line — the size of $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "To give the answer, print one line ! s with a line break in the end , where $$$s$$$ should be the string picked by the jury. After that, your program should flush the output and terminate gracefully.",
