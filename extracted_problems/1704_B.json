  "statement": "Luke likes to eat. There are $$$n$$$ piles of food aligned in a straight line in front of him. The $$$i$$$-th pile contains $$$a_i$$$ units of food. Luke will walk from the $$$1$$$-st pile towards the $$$n$$$-th pile, and he wants to eat every pile of food without walking back. When Luke reaches the $$$i$$$-th pile, he can eat that pile if and only if $$$|v - a_i| \\leq x$$$, where $$$x$$$ is a fixed integer, and $$$v$$$ is Luke's food affinity. Before Luke starts to walk, he can set $$$v$$$ to any integer. Also, for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$), Luke can change his food affinity to any integer before he eats the $$$i$$$-th pile. Find the minimum number of changes needed to eat every pile of food. Note that the initial choice for $$$v$$$ is not considered as a change.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. For each test case, the first line contains two integers, $$$n, x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of piles, and the maximum difference between the size of a pile and Luke's food affinity, such that Luke can eat the pile. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output an integer on a separate line, which is the minimum number of changes needed.",
