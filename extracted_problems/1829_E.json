  "statement": "You are given an $$$n \\times m$$$ grid $$$a$$$ of non-negative integers. The value $$$a_{i,j}$$$ represents the depth of water at the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column. A lake is a set of cells such that: each cell in the set has $$$a_{i,j} > 0$$$, and there exists a path between any pair of cells in the lake by going up, down, left, or right a number of times and without stepping on a cell with $$$a_{i,j} = 0$$$. The volume of a lake is the sum of depths of all the cells in the lake. Find the largest volume of a lake in the grid.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of rows and columns of the grid, respectively. Then $$$n$$$ lines follow each with $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,j}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_{i,j} \\leq 1000$$$) — the depth of the water at each cell. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the largest volume of a lake in the grid.",
