  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ block towers in a row, where tower $$$i$$$ has a height of $$$a_i$$$. You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings look as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following operation: Choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$; $$$i \\neq j$$$), and move a block from tower $$$i$$$ to tower $$$j$$$. This essentially decreases $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$ and increases $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$. You think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined as $$$\\max(a)-\\min(a)$$$. What's the minimum possible ugliness you can achieve, after any number of days?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ cases follow. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the number of buildings. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^7$$$) — the heights of the buildings.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible ugliness of the buildings.",
