  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. In one operation, you can subtract any power of $$$k$$$ from $$$n$$$. Formally, in one operation, you can replace $$$n$$$ by $$$(n-k^x)$$$ for any non-negative integer $$$x$$$. Find the minimum number of operations required to make $$$n$$$ equal to $$$0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 10^9$$$).",
