  "statement": "Amidst skyscrapers in the bustling metropolis of Metro Manila, the newest Noiph mall in the Philippines has just been completed! The construction manager, Penchick, ordered a state-of-the-art monument to be built with $$$n$$$ pillars. The heights of the monument's pillars can be represented as an array $$$h$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers, where $$$h_i$$$ represents the height of the $$$i$$$-th pillar for all $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$. Penchick wants the heights of the pillars to be in non-decreasing order, i.e. $$$h_i \\le h_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n - 1$$$. However, due to confusion, the monument was built such that the heights of the pillars are in non-increasing order instead, i.e. $$$h_i \\ge h_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n - 1$$$. Luckily, Penchick can modify the monument and do the following operation on the pillars as many times as necessary: Modify the height of a pillar to any positive integer. Formally, choose an index $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$ and a positive integer $$$x$$$. Then, assign $$$h_i := x$$$. Help Penchick determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the heights of the monument's pillars non-decreasing .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$) — the number of pillars. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le h_i \\le n$$$ and $$$h_i\\ge h_{i+1}$$$) — the height of the pillars. Please take note that the given array $$$h$$$ is non-increasing. Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to make the heights of the pillars non-decreasing .",
