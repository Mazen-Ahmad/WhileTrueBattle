  "statement": "Given a rooted tree with the root at vertex $$$1$$$. For any vertex $$$i$$$ ($$$1 < i \\leq n$$$) in the tree, there is an edge connecting vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i < i$$$), with a weight equal to $$$t_i$$$. Iris does not know the values of $$$t_i$$$, but she knows that $$$\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=2}^n t_i = w$$$ and each of the $$$t_i$$$ is a non-negative integer . The vertices of the tree are numbered in a special way: the numbers of the vertices in each subtree are consecutive integers. In other words, the vertices of the tree are numbered in the order of a depth-first search. The tree in this picture satisfies the condition. For example, in the subtree of vertex $$$2$$$, the vertex numbers are $$$2, 3, 4, 5$$$, which are consecutive integers. The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, as in the subtree of vertex $$$2$$$, the vertex numbers $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ are not consecutive integers. We define $$$\\operatorname{dist}(u, v)$$$ as the length of the simple path between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in the tree. Next, there will be $$$n - 1$$$ events: Iris is given integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, indicating that $$$t_x = y$$$. After each event, Iris wants to know the maximum possible value of $$$\\operatorname{dist}(i, i \\bmod n + 1)$$$ independently for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i\\le n$$$). She only needs to know the sum of these $$$n$$$ values. Please help Iris quickly get the answers. Note that when calculating the maximum possible values of $$$\\operatorname{dist}(i, i \\bmod n + 1)$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{dist}(j, j \\bmod n + 1)$$$ for $$$i \\ne j$$$, the unknown edge weights may be different .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq w \\leq 10^{12}$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the sum of the edge weights. The second line of each test case contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i < i$$$) — the description of the edges of the tree. Then follow $$$n-1$$$ lines indicating the events. Each line contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$2 \\leq x \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq y \\leq w$$$), indicating that $$$t_x = y$$$. It is guaranteed that all $$$x$$$ in the events are distinct. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all $$$y$$$ equals $$$w$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one line containing $$$n-1$$$ integers, each representing the answer after each event.",
