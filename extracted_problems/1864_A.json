  "statement": "You are given three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$n$$$. Your task is to construct an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers which satisfies the following conditions: $$$a_1=x$$$, $$$a_n=y$$$; $$$a$$$ is strictly increasing (i.e. $$$a_1 < a_2 < \\ldots < a_n$$$); if we denote $$$b_i=a_{i+1}-a_{i}$$$ for $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$$$, then $$$b$$$ is strictly decreasing (i.e. $$$b_1 > b_2 > \\ldots > b_{n-1}$$$). If there is no such array $$$a$$$, print a single integer $$$-1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le x < y \\le 1000,3 \\le n \\le 1000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there is no solution, print a single integer $$$-1$$$.",
