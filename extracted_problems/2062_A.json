  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and/or $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$. In one operation, you can select a non-empty subsequence $$$t$$$ from $$$s$$$ such that any two adjacent characters in $$$t$$$ are different. Then, you flip each character of $$$t$$$ ($$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ becomes $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ becomes $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$). For example, if $$$s=\\mathtt{\\underline{0}0\\underline{101}}$$$ and $$$t=s_1s_3s_4s_5=\\mathtt{0101}$$$, after the operation, $$$s$$$ becomes $$$\\mathtt{\\underline{1}0\\underline{010}}$$$. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to change all characters in $$$s$$$ to $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$. Recall that for a string $$$s = s_1s_2\\ldots s_n$$$, any string $$$t=s_{i_1}s_{i_2}\\ldots s_{i_k}$$$ ($$$k\\ge 1$$$) where $$$1\\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots <i_k\\leq n$$$ is a subsequence of $$$s$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of input test cases. The only line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1\\le |s|\\le 50$$$), where $$$|s|$$$ represents the length of $$$s$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to change all characters in $$$s$$$ to $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$.",
