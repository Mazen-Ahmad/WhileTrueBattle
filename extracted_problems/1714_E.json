  "statement": "You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ You can apply the following operation an arbitrary number of times: select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) and replace the value of the element $$$a_i$$$ with the value $$$a_i + (a_i \\bmod 10)$$$, where $$$a_i \\bmod 10$$$ is the remainder of the integer dividing $$$a_i$$$ by $$$10$$$. For a single index (value $$$i$$$), this operation can be applied multiple times. If the operation is applied repeatedly to the same index, then the current value of $$$a_i$$$ is taken into account each time. For example, if $$$a_i=47$$$ then after the first operation we get $$$a_i=47+7=54$$$, and after the second operation we get $$$a_i=54+4=58$$$. Check if it is possible to make all array elements equal by applying multiple (possibly zero) operations. For example, you have an array $$$[6, 11]$$$. Let's apply this operation to the first element of the array. Let's replace $$$a_1 = 6$$$ with $$$a_1 + (a_1 \\bmod 10) = 6 + (6 \\bmod 10) = 6 + 6 = 12$$$. We get the array $$$[12, 11]$$$. Then apply this operation to the second element of the array. Let's replace $$$a_2 = 11$$$ with $$$a_2 + (a_2 \\bmod 10) = 11 + (11 \\bmod 10) = 11 + 1 = 12$$$. We get the array $$$[12, 12]$$$. Thus, by applying $$$2$$$ operations, you can make all elements of an array equal.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. What follows is a description of each test case. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — array elements. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print: YES if it is possible to make all array elements equal; NO otherwise. You can print YES and NO in any case (for example, the strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive answer) .",
