  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$q = 1$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. There is a process that takes place on arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and length $$$n-1$$$ respectively. The process is an infinite sequence of operations. Each operation is as follows: First, choose a random integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n-1$$$). Then, simultaneously set $$$a_i = \\min\\left(a_i, \\frac{a_i+a_{i+1}-b_i}{2}\\right)$$$ and $$$a_{i+1} = \\max\\left(a_{i+1}, \\frac{a_i+a_{i+1}+b_i}{2}\\right)$$$ without any rounding (so values may become non-integer). See notes for an example of an operation. It can be proven that array $$$a$$$ converges, i. e. for each $$$i$$$ there exists a limit $$$a_i$$$ converges to. Let function $$$F(a, b)$$$ return the value $$$a_1$$$ converges to after a process on $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. You are given array $$$b$$$, but not array $$$a$$$. However, you are given a third array $$$c$$$. Array $$$a$$$ is good if it contains only integers and satisfies $$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq c_i$$$ for $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. Your task is to count the number of good arrays $$$a$$$ where $$$F(a, b) \\geq x$$$ for $$$q$$$ values of $$$x$$$. Since the number of arrays can be very large, print it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2 \\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le c_i \\le 100$$$). The third line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \\le b_i \\le 100$$$). The fourth line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$q=1$$$). The fifth line contains $$$q$$$ space separated integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_q$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\le x_i \\le 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$q$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th integer is the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query, i. e. the number of good arrays $$$a$$$ where $$$F(a, b) \\geq x_i$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
