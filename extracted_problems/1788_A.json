  "statement": "You are given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Each element of $$$a$$$ is $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$. Find out if an integer $$$k$$$ exists so that the following conditions are met. $$$1 \\leq k \\leq n-1$$$, and $$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot a_k = a_{k+1} \\cdot a_{k+2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot a_n$$$. If there exist multiple $$$k$$$ that satisfy the given condition, print the smallest.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 2$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no such $$$k$$$, print $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, print the smallest possible $$$k$$$.",
