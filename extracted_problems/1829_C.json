  "statement": "Victor wants to become \" Mr. Perfectly Fine \". For that, he needs to acquire a certain set of skills. More precisely, he has $$$2$$$ skills he needs to acquire. Victor has $$$n$$$ books. Reading book $$$i$$$ takes him $$$m_i$$$ minutes and will give him some (possibly none) of the required two skills, represented by a binary string of length $$$2$$$. What is the minimum amount of time required so that Victor acquires all of the two skills?",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of books available. Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. Line $$$i$$$ contains a positive integer $$$m_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m_i \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) and a binary string of length $$$2$$$, where $$$s_{i1} = 1$$$ if reading book $$$i$$$ acquires Victor skill $$$1$$$, and $$$s_{i1} = 0$$$ otherwise, and $$$s_{i2} = 1$$$ if reading book $$$i$$$ acquires Victor skill $$$2$$$, and $$$s_{i2} = 0$$$ otherwise. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer denoting the minimum amount of minutes required for Victor to obtain both needed skills and $$$-1$$$ in case it's impossible to obtain the two skills after reading any amount of books.",
