  "statement": "Vlad came home and found out that someone had reconfigured the old thermostat to the temperature of $$$a$$$. The thermostat can only be set to a temperature from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive, the temperature cannot change by less than $$$x$$$. Formally, in one operation you can reconfigure the thermostat from temperature $$$a$$$ to temperature $$$b$$$ if $$$|a - b| \\ge x$$$ and $$$l \\le b \\le r$$$. You are given $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. Find the minimum number of operations required to get temperature $$$b$$$ from temperature $$$a$$$, or say that it is impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each case contains three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$) — range of temperature and minimum temperature change. The second line of each case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$l \\le a, b \\le r$$$) — the initial and final temperatures.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$t$$$ numbers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. If it is impossible to achieve the temperature $$$b$$$, output -1 , otherwise output the minimum number of operations.",
