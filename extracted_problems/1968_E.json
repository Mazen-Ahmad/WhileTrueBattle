  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$. You choose $$$n$$$ cells $$$(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),\\dots,(x_n,y_n)$$$ in the grid $$$n\\times n$$$ where $$$1\\le x_i\\le n$$$ and $$$1\\le y_i\\le n$$$. Let $$$\\mathcal{H}$$$ be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. Your task is to maximize the size of $$$\\mathcal{H}$$$. Examples of sets and their construction are given in the notes. If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any. Manhattan distance between cells $$$(x_1,y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2,y_2)$$$ equals $$$|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 50$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 10^3$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ points which maximize the size of $$$\\mathcal{H}$$$. It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each test case.",
