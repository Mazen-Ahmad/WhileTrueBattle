  "statement": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. There are $$$n$$$ ( $$$n$$$ is even ) integers written on a blackboard, represented by $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$. There is also a given integer $$$k$$$ and an integer score that is initially $$$0$$$. The game lasts for $$$\\frac{n}{2}$$$ turns, in which the following events happen sequentially: Alice selects an integer from the blackboard and erases it. Let's call Alice's chosen integer $$$a$$$. Bob selects an integer from the blackboard and erases it. Let's call Bob's chosen integer $$$b$$$. If $$$a+b=k$$$, add $$$1$$$ to score . Alice is playing to minimize the score while Bob is playing to maximize the score . Assuming both players use optimal strategies, what is the score after the game ends?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5, 1 \\leq k \\leq 2\\cdot n$$$, $$$n$$$ is even). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq n$$$) — the integers on the blackboard. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the score if both players play optimally.",
