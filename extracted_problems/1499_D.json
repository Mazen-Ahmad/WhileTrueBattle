  "statement": "You are given three positive (greater than zero) integers $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ and $$$x$$$. You have to find the number of pairs of positive integers $$$(a, b)$$$ such that equality $$$c \\cdot lcm(a, b) - d \\cdot gcd(a, b) = x$$$ holds. Where $$$lcm(a, b)$$$ is the least common multiple of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ and $$$gcd(a, b)$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing three integer $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le c, d, x \\le 10^7$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the number of pairs ($$$a, b$$$) such that the above equality holds.",
