  "statement": "You have a board represented as a grid with $$$2 \\times n$$$ cells. The first $$$k_1$$$ cells on the first row and first $$$k_2$$$ cells on the second row are colored in white. All other cells are colored in black. You have $$$w$$$ white dominoes ($$$2 \\times 1$$$ tiles, both cells are colored in white) and $$$b$$$ black dominoes ($$$2 \\times 1$$$ tiles, both cells are colored in black). You can place a white domino on the board if both board's cells are white and not occupied by any other domino. In the same way, you can place a black domino if both cells are black and not occupied by any other domino. Can you place all $$$w + b$$$ dominoes on the board if you can place dominoes both horizontally and vertically?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 3000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k_1$$$ and $$$k_2$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$; $$$0 \\le k_1, k_2 \\le n$$$). The second line of each test case contains two integers $$$w$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \\le w, b \\le n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if it's possible to place all $$$w + b$$$ dominoes on the board and NO , otherwise. You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES are all recognized as positive answer).",
