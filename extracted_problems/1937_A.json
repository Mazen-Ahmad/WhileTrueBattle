  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Initially, $$$a_i=i$$$ for each $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. The operation $$$\\texttt{swap}(k)$$$ for an integer $$$k \\ge 2$$$ is defined as follows: Let $$$d$$$ be the largest divisor$$$^\\dagger$$$ of $$$k$$$ which is not equal to $$$k$$$ itself. Then swap the elements $$$a_d$$$ and $$$a_k$$$. Suppose you perform $$$\\texttt{swap}(i)$$$ for each $$$i=2,3,\\ldots, n$$$ in this exact order. Find the position of $$$1$$$ in the resulting array. In other words, find such $$$j$$$ that $$$a_j = 1$$$ after performing these operations. $$$^\\dagger$$$ An integer $$$x$$$ is a divisor of $$$y$$$ if there exists an integer $$$z$$$ such that $$$y = x \\cdot z$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$) â€” the length of the array $$$a$$$.",
