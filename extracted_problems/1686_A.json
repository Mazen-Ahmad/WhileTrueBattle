  "statement": "You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. After you watched the amazing film \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\", you came up with the following operation. In one operation, you choose $$$n-1$$$ elements of the array and replace each of them with their arithmetic mean (which doesn't have to be an integer). For example, from the array $$$[1, 2, 3, 1]$$$ we can get the array $$$[2, 2, 2, 1]$$$, if we choose the first three elements, or we can get the array $$$[\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{4}{3}, 3, \\frac{4}{3}]$$$, if we choose all elements except the third. Is it possible to make all elements of the array equal by performing a finite number of such operations?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 200$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the number of integers. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is possible to make all elements equal after some number of operations, output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$. Otherwise, output $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$. You can output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$ in any case (for example, strings $$$\\texttt{yEs}$$$, $$$\\texttt{yes}$$$, $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$ will be recognized as a positive response).",
