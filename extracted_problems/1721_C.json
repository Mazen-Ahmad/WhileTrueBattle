  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, which is sorted in non-descending order. You decided to perform the following steps to create array $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$: Create an array $$$d$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ arbitrary non-negative integers. Set $$$b_i = a_i + d_i$$$ for each $$$b_i$$$. Sort the array $$$b$$$ in non-descending order. You are given the resulting array $$$b$$$. For each index $$$i$$$, calculate what is the minimum and maximum possible value of $$$d_i$$$ you can choose in order to get the given array $$$b$$$. Note that the minimum (maximum) $$$d_i$$$-s are independent of each other, i. e. they can be obtained from different possible arrays $$$d$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of arrays $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$d$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$; $$$a_i \\le a_{i+1}$$$) — the array $$$a$$$ in non-descending order. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$; $$$b_i \\le b_{i+1}$$$) — the array $$$b$$$ in non-descending order. Additional constraints on the input: there is at least one way to obtain the array $$$b$$$ from the $$$a$$$ by choosing an array $$$d$$$ consisting of non-negative integers ; the sum of $$$n$$$ doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print two lines. In the first line, print $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1^{min}, d_2^{min}, \\dots, d_n^{min}$$$, where $$$d_i^{min}$$$ is the minimum possible value you can add to $$$a_i$$$. Secondly, print $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1^{max}, d_2^{max}, \\dots, d_n^{max}$$$, where $$$d_i^{max}$$$ is the maximum possible value you can add to $$$a_i$$$. All $$$d_i^{min}$$$ and $$$d_i^{max}$$$ values are independent of each other. In other words, for each $$$i$$$, $$$d_i^{min}$$$ is just the minimum value among all possible values of $$$d_i$$$.",
