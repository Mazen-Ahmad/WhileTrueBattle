  "statement": "Moamen and Ezzat are playing a game. They create an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers where every element is less than $$$2^k$$$. Moamen wins if $$$a_1 \\,\\&\\, a_2 \\,\\&\\, a_3 \\,\\&\\, \\ldots \\,\\&\\, a_n \\ge a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus a_3 \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus a_n$$$. Here $$$\\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation , and $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation . Please calculate the number of winning for Moamen arrays $$$a$$$. As the result may be very large, print the value modulo $$$1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$ ($$$10^9 + 7$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5$$$)— the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le k \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single value — the number of different arrays that Moamen wins with. Print the result modulo $$$1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$ ($$$10^9 + 7$$$).",
