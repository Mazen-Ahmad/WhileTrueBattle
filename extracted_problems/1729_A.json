  "statement": "Vlad went into his appartment house entrance, now he is on the $$$1$$$-th floor. He was going to call the elevator to go up to his apartment. There are only two elevators in his house. Vlad knows for sure that: the first elevator is currently on the floor $$$a$$$ (it is currently motionless), the second elevator is located on floor $$$b$$$ and goes to floor $$$c$$$ ($$$b \\ne c$$$). Please note, if $$$b=1$$$, then the elevator is already leaving the floor $$$1$$$ and Vlad does not have time to enter it. If you call the first elevator, it will immediately start to go to the floor $$$1$$$. If you call the second one, then first it will reach the floor $$$c$$$ and only then it will go to the floor $$$1$$$. It takes $$$|x - y|$$$ seconds for each elevator to move from floor $$$x$$$ to floor $$$y$$$. Vlad wants to call an elevator that will come to him faster. Help him choose such an elevator.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains the only $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by $$$t$$$ lines, three integers each $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b, c \\le 10^8$$$, $$$b \\ne c$$$) — floor numbers described in the statement.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$t$$$ numbers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As an answer, output: $$$1$$$, if it is better to call the first elevator; $$$2$$$, if it is better to call the second one; $$$3$$$, if it doesn't matter which elevator to call (both elevators will arrive in the same time).",
