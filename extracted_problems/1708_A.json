  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You are allowed to perform this operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$2 \\le i \\le n$$$), and change $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_i - a_{i-1}$$$. Is it possible to make $$$a_i=0$$$ for all $$$2\\le i\\le n$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" YES \" (without quotes), if it is possible to change $$$a_i$$$ to $$$0$$$ for all $$$2 \\le i \\le n$$$, and \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print letters in any case (upper or lower).",
