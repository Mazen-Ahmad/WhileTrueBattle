  "statement": "You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$. You are also given an array $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$. Let $$$S$$$ denote the random multiset (i. e., it may contain equal elements) constructed as follows: Initially, $$$S$$$ is empty. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, insert $$$a_i$$$ into $$$S$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{p_i}{10^4}$$$. Note that each element is inserted independently. Denote $$$f(S)$$$ as the bitwise XOR of all elements of $$$S$$$. Please calculate the expected value of $$$(f(S))^2$$$. Output the answer modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. Formally, let $$$M = 10^9 + 7$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1023$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le 10^4$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the expected value of $$$(f(S))^2$$$, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
