  "statement": "The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a tower out of them. Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts exactly $$$1$$$ cube on top of the tower or removes exactly $$$1$$$ cube from the top of the tower. Is it possible that after $$$n$$$ moves, the resulting tower has exactly $$$m$$$ cubes?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \"Yes\" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower with $$$m$$$ cubes, and \"No\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be accepted as a positive answer.",
