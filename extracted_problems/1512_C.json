  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of the characters ' 0 ', ' 1 ', and ' ? '. You need to replace all the characters with ' ? ' in the string $$$s$$$ by ' 0 ' or ' 1 ' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has exactly $$$a$$$ characters ' 0 ' and exactly $$$b$$$ characters ' 1 '. Note that each of the characters ' ? ' is replaced independently from the others. A string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is called a palindrome if the equality $$$t[i] = t[n-i+1]$$$ is true for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$). For example, if $$$s=$$$\" 01?????0 \", $$$a=4$$$ and $$$b=4$$$, then you can replace the characters ' ? ' in the following ways: \" 01011010 \"; \" 01100110 \". For the given string $$$s$$$ and the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, replace all the characters with ' ? ' in the string $$$s$$$ by ' 0 ' or ' 1 ' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has exactly $$$a$$$ characters ' 0 ' and exactly $$$b$$$ characters ' 1 '.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \\le a, b \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$a + b \\ge 1$$$). The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$a+b$$$, consisting of the characters ' 0 ', ' 1 ', and ' ? '. It is guaranteed that the sum of the string lengths of $$$s$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output: \" -1 \", if you can't replace all the characters ' ? ' in the string $$$s$$$ by ' 0 ' or ' 1 ' so that the string becomes a palindrome and that it contains exactly $$$a$$$ characters ' 0 ' and exactly $$$b$$$ characters ' 1 '; the string that is obtained as a result of the replacement, otherwise. If there are several suitable ways to replace characters, you can output any.",
