  "statement": "Call an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ a derangement if the following property holds: Let $$$c$$$ be an array of length $$$m$$$ such that $$$c_i = b_i$$$ over all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq m$$$. Sort $$$c$$$ in non-decreasing order. If $$$b_i\\neq c_i$$$ over all $$$1\\leq i \\leq m$$$, then $$$b$$$ is a derangement . For example, If $$$b = [4,8,3,1]$$$, then $$$c = [1, 3, 4, 8]$$$ after getting sorted. Since $$$b_i \\neq c_i$$$ in all positions, $$$b$$$ is a derangement . If $$$b = [3,2,1]$$$, then $$$c = [1, 2, 3]$$$ after getting sorted. Since $$$b_2 = c_2$$$, $$$b$$$ is not a derangement . You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. In one operation, you can delete an element from $$$a$$$. The order of the remaining elements is preserved after each deletion. Output whether it is possible to perform some (possibly none) operations such that the remaining elements form a derangement . If it is possible, output any possible remaining array. The remaining array must be non-empty.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — denoting the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, on a new line, if it is possible to perform operations such that the remaining array is a derangement , output YES . Otherwise, output NO . You can output in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\" , \"yes\" , \"Yes\" , and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses. If your response was positive, output two more lines in the following format: The first line should contain an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$), the number of elements that remain in the array. The second line should contain $$$d_1, d_2 \\ldots, d_k$$$, the elements that remain in the array. It must be possible to acquire array $$$d$$$ after performing some operations on $$$a$$$. Array $$$d$$$ must be a derangement .",
