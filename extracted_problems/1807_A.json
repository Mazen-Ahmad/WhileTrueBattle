  "statement": "You are given three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ such that exactly one of these two equations is true: $$$a+b=c$$$ $$$a-b=c$$$ Output + if the first equation is true, and - otherwise.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 162$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of each test case consists of three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq 9$$$, $$$-8 \\leq c \\leq 18$$$). The additional constraint on the input: it will be generated so that exactly one of the two equations will be true.",
