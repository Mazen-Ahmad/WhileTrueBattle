  "statement": "Given an integer $$$n$$$, find an integer $$$x$$$ such that: $$$2 \\leq x \\leq n$$$. The sum of multiples of $$$x$$$ that are less than or equal to $$$n$$$ is maximized. Formally, $$$x + 2x + 3x + \\dots + kx$$$ where $$$kx \\leq n$$$ is maximized over all possible values of $$$x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output an integer, the optimal value of $$$x$$$. It can be shown there is only one unique answer.",
