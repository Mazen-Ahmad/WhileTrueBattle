  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ block towers, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th tower consists of $$$a_i$$$ blocks. In one move, you can move one block from tower $$$i$$$ to tower $$$j$$$, but only if $$$a_i > a_j$$$. That move increases $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$ and decreases $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$. You can perform as many moves as you would like (possibly, zero). What's the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower $$$1$$$ after the moves?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of towers. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of blocks on each tower. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower $$$1$$$ after you make any number of moves (possibly, zero).",
