  "statement": "Rayan wants to present a gift to Reyhaneh to win her heart. However, Reyhaneh is particular and will only accept a k-harmonic set of permutations . We define a k-harmonic set of permutations as a set of $$$k$$$ pairwise distinct permutations $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$$$ of size $$$n$$$ such that for every pair of indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ (where $$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$), the following condition holds: $$$$$$ p_1[i] + p_2[i] + \\ldots + p_k[i] = p_1[j] + p_2[j] + \\ldots + p_k[j] $$$$$$ Your task is to help Rayan by either providing a valid k-harmonic set of permutations for given values of $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ or by determining that such a set does not exist. We call a sequence of length $$$n$$$ a permutation if it contains every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, k \\leq 10^5$$$). The sum of $$$n \\cdot k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if a k-harmonic set of permutations exists, print YES on the first line. Then, print $$$k$$$ lines, each containing a distinct permutation of the integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. If no such set exists, print NO on the first line. You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response). If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.",
