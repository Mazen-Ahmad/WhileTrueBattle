  "statement": "Evirir the dragon has many friends. They have 3 friends! That is one more than the average dragon. You are given integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$y$$$. There are $$$n$$$ dragons sitting in a circle. The dragons are numbered $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$), dragon $$$i$$$ is friends with dragon $$$i - 1$$$ and $$$i + 1$$$, where dragon $$$0$$$ is defined to be dragon $$$n$$$ and dragon $$$n + 1$$$ is defined to be dragon $$$1$$$. Additionally, dragons $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are friends with each other (if they are already friends, this changes nothing). Note that all friendships are mutual. Output $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ such that for each dragon $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$), the following holds: Let $$$f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_k$$$ be the friends of dragon $$$i$$$. Then $$$a_i = \\operatorname{mex}(a_{f_1}, a_{f_2}, \\ldots, a_{f_k})$$$.$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_m$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$t$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$c$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le x < y \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ space-separated non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) on a line that satisfy the condition in the statement. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that under the problem constraints, a solution with $$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$ always exists.",
