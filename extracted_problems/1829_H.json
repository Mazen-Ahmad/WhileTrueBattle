  "statement": "Sadly, the problem setter couldn't think of an interesting story, thus he just asks you to solve the following problem. Given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers, count the number of non-empty subsequences for which the bitwise $$$\\mathsf{AND}$$$ of the elements in the subsequence has exactly $$$k$$$ set bits in its binary representation. The answer may be large, so output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. Recall that the subsequence of an array $$$a$$$ is a sequence that can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by removing some (possibly, zero) elements. For example, $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, $$$[3]$$$, $$$[1, 3]$$$ are subsequences of $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, but $$$[3, 2]$$$ and $$$[4, 5, 6]$$$ are not. Note that $$$\\mathsf{AND}$$$ represents the bitwise AND operation .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case consists of two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le k \\le 6$$$) — the length of the array and the number of set bits that the bitwise $$$\\mathsf{AND}$$$ the counted subsequences should have in their binary representation. The second line of each test case consists of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 63$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of subsequences that have exactly $$$k$$$ set bits in their bitwise $$$\\mathsf{AND}$$$ value's binary representation. The answer may be large, so output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
