  "statement": "You are given three non-negative integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$x$$$. Find the maximum possible sum of elements in an array consisting of non-negative integers, which has $$$n$$$ elements, its MEX is equal to $$$k$$$, and all its elements do not exceed $$$x$$$. If such an array does not exist, output $$$-1$$$. The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance: The MEX of $$$[2,2,1]$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array. The MEX of $$$[3,1,0,1]$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not. The MEX of $$$[0,3,1,2]$$$ is $$$4$$$, because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ belong to the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, k, x \\leq 200$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single number — the maximum sum of elements in a valid array, or $$$-1$$$, if such an array does not exist.",
