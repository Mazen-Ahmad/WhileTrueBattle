  "statement": "You are given a number $$$k$$$ and a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters ' . ' and ' * '. You want to replace some of the ' * ' characters with ' x ' characters so that the following conditions are met: The first character ' * ' in the original string should be replaced with ' x '; The last character ' * ' in the original string should be replaced with ' x '; The distance between two neighboring replaced characters ' x ' must not exceed $$$k$$$ (more formally, if you replaced characters at positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i < j$$$) and at positions $$$[i+1, j-1]$$$ there is no \"x\" symbol, then $$$j-i$$$ must be no more than $$$k$$$). For example, if $$$n=7$$$, $$$s=$$$ .**.*** and $$$k=3$$$, then the following strings will satisfy the conditions above: .xx.*xx ; .x*.x*x ; .xx.xxx . But, for example, the following strings will not meet the conditions: .**.*xx (the first character ' * ' should be replaced with ' x '); .x*.xx* (the last character ' * ' should be replaced with ' x '); .x*.*xx (the distance between characters at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$6$$$ is greater than $$$k=3$$$). Given $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$s$$$, find the minimum number of ' * ' characters that must be replaced with ' x ' in order to meet the above conditions.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 50$$$). The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters ' . ' and ' * '. It is guaranteed that there is at least one ' * ' in the string $$$s$$$. It is guaranteed that the distance between any two neighboring ' * ' characters does not exceed $$$k$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output the minimum number of ' * ' characters that must be replaced with ' x ' characters in order to satisfy the conditions above.",
