  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, $$$l\\le r$$$. Find the largest possible value of $$$a \\bmod b$$$ over all pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ of integers for which $$$r\\ge a \\ge b \\ge l$$$. As a reminder, $$$a \\bmod b$$$ is a remainder we get when dividing $$$a$$$ by $$$b$$$. For example, $$$26 \\bmod 8 = 2$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains one positive integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1\\le t\\le 10^4)$$$, denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$1\\le l \\le r \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For every test case, output the largest possible value of $$$a \\bmod b$$$ over all pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ of integers for which $$$r\\ge a \\ge b \\ge l$$$.",
