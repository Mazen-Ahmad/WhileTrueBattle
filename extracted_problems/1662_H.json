  "statement": "Bethany would like to tile her bathroom. The bathroom has width $$$w$$$ centimeters and length $$$l$$$ centimeters. If Bethany simply used the basic tiles of size $$$1 \\times 1$$$ centimeters, she would use $$$w \\cdot l$$$ of them. However, she has something different in mind. On the interior of the floor she wants to use the $$$1 \\times 1$$$ tiles. She needs exactly $$$(w-2) \\cdot (l-2)$$$ of these. On the floor boundary she wants to use tiles of size $$$1 \\times a$$$ for some positive integer $$$a$$$. The tiles can also be rotated by $$$90$$$ degrees. For which values of $$$a$$$ can Bethany tile the bathroom floor as described? Note that $$$a$$$ can also be $$$1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case consist of a single line, which contains two integers $$$w$$$, $$$l$$$ ($$$3 \\leq w, l \\leq 10^{9}$$$) — the dimensions of the bathroom.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\le k$$$) — the number of valid values of $$$a$$$ for the given test case — followed by $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\dots, a_k$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i$$$) — the valid values of $$$a$$$. The values $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$ have to be sorted from smallest to largest. It is guaranteed that under the problem constraints, the output contains at most $$$200\\,000$$$ integers.",
