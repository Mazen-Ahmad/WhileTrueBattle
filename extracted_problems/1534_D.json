  "statement": "This is an interactive problem . Little Dormi was faced with an awkward problem at the carnival: he has to guess the edges of an unweighted tree of $$$n$$$ nodes! The nodes of the tree are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The game master only allows him to ask one type of question: Little Dormi picks a node $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le r \\le n$$$), and the game master will reply with an array $$$d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n$$$, where $$$d_i$$$ is the length of the shortest path from node $$$r$$$ to $$$i$$$, for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. Additionally, to make the game unfair challenge Little Dormi the game master will allow at most $$$\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil$$$ questions, where $$$\\lceil x \\rceil$$$ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to $$$x$$$. Faced with the stomach-churning possibility of not being able to guess the tree, Little Dormi needs your help to devise a winning strategy! Note that the game master creates the tree before the game starts, and does not change it during the game.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2\\,000$$$), the number of nodes in the tree. You will then begin interaction.",
  "outputFormat": "When your program has found the tree, first output a line consisting of a single \" ! \" followed by $$$n-1$$$ lines each with two space separated integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, denoting an edge connecting nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le n$$$). Once you are done, terminate your program normally immediately after flushing the output stream. You may output the edges in any order and an edge $$$(a,b)$$$ is considered the same as an edge $$$(b,a)$$$. Answering is not considered as a query.",
