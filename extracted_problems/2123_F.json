  "statement": "Call a permutation$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ good if $$$\\gcd(p_i, i)$$$$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ $$$ > 1$$$ for all $$$2 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. Find a good permutation with the minimum number of fixed points $$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$ across all good permutations of length $$$n$$$. If there are multiple such permutations, print any of them. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array that contains every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once, in any order. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$$$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. $$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$A fixed point of a permutation $$$p$$$ is an index $$$j$$$ ($$$1\\leq j\\leq n$$$) such that $$$p_j = j$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
