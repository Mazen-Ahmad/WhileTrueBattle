  "statement": "Polycarp got an array of integers $$$a[1 \\dots n]$$$ as a gift. Now he wants to perform a certain number of operations (possibly zero) so that all elements of the array become the same (that is, to become $$$a_1=a_2=\\dots=a_n$$$). In one operation, he can take some indices in the array and increase the elements of the array at those indices by $$$1$$$. For example, let $$$a=[4,2,1,6,2]$$$. He can perform the following operation: select indices 1, 2, and 4 and increase elements of the array in those indices by $$$1$$$. As a result, in one operation, he can get a new state of the array $$$a=[5,3,1,7,2]$$$. What is the minimum number of operations it can take so that all elements of the array become equal to each other (that is, to become $$$a_1=a_2=\\dots=a_n$$$)?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. The following are descriptions of the input test cases. The first line of the description of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. The second line of the description of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations to make all elements of the array $$$a$$$ equal.",
