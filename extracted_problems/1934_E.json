  "statement": "Given an integer $$$n$$$, you construct an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, where $$$a_i = i$$$ for all integers $$$i$$$ in the range $$$[1, n]$$$. An operation on this array is defined as follows: Select three distinct indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, and $$$k$$$ from the array, and let $$$x = a_i$$$, $$$y = a_j$$$, and $$$z = a_k$$$. Update the array as follows: $$$a_i = \\operatorname{lcm}(y, z)$$$, $$$a_j = \\operatorname{lcm}(x, z)$$$, and $$$a_k = \\operatorname{lcm}(x, y)$$$, where $$$\\operatorname{lcm}$$$ represents the least common multiple. Your task is to provide a possible sequence of operations, containing at most $$$\\lfloor \\frac{n}{6} \\rfloor + 5$$$ operations such that after executing these operations, if you create a set containing the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of all subsequences with a size greater than $$$1$$$ , then all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ should be present in this set. After all the operations $$$a_i \\le 10^{18}$$$ should hold for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. We can show that an answer always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^2$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^{4}$$$) — the length of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^{4}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "The first line should contain an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\leq k \\leq \\lfloor \\frac{n}{6} \\rfloor + 5$$$) — where $$$k$$$ is the number of operations. The next $$$k$$$ lines should contain the description of each operation i.e. $$$3$$$ integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$k$$$, where $$$1 \\leq i, j, k \\leq n$$$ and all must be distinct.",
