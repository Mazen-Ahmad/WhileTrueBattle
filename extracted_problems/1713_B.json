  "statement": "Consider an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You may perform the following operation: select two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$), then decrease all elements $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\dots, a_r$$$ by $$$1$$$. Let's call $$$f(a)$$$ the minimum number of operations needed to change array $$$a$$$ into an array of $$$n$$$ zeros. Determine if for all permutations$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$b$$$ of $$$a$$$, $$$f(a) \\leq f(b)$$$ is true. $$$^\\dagger$$$ An array $$$b$$$ is a permutation of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ consists of the elements of $$$a$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[4,2,3,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$[3,2,4,4]$$$ while $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation of $$$[1,2,3]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — description of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" YES \" (without quotes) if for all permutations $$$b$$$ of $$$a$$$, $$$f(a) \\leq f(b)$$$ is true, and \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output \" YES \" and \" NO \" in any case (for example, strings \" yEs \", \" yes \" and \" Yes \" will be recognized as a positive response).",
