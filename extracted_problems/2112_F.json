  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ variables; let's denote the value of the $$$i$$$-th variable as $$$a_i$$$. There are also $$$m$$$ operations which will be applied to these variables; the $$$i$$$-th operation is described by three integers $$$x_i, y_i, z_i$$$. When the $$$i$$$-th operation is applied, the variable $$$x_i$$$ gets assigned the following value: $$$\\min(a_{x_i}, a_{y_i} + z_i)$$$. Every operation will be applied exactly once , but their order is not fixed; they can be applied in any order. Let's call a sequence of initial variable values $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ stable , if no matter in which order we apply operations, the resulting values will be the same. If the resulting value of the $$$i$$$-th variable depends on the order of operations, then the sequence of initial variable values is called $$$i$$$- unstable . You have to process $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, you will be given initial values $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$; before applying the operations, you can at most $$$k$$$ times choose a variable and decrease it by $$$1$$$. For every variable $$$i$$$, you have to independently determine if it is possible to transform the given values into an $$$i$$$-unstable sequence.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 500$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le 4 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of variables and operations, respectively. Then, $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains three integers $$$x_i, y_i, z_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$; $$$x_i \\ne y_i$$$; $$$0 \\le z_i \\le 10^5$$$) — the description of the $$$i$$$-th operation. The next line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 1000$$$) — the number of queries. Each query consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$) — the maximum number of times you can choose a variable and decrease it by $$$1$$$; the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the initial values of the variables.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print a string of $$$n$$$ zeroes and/or ones. The $$$i$$$-th character should be 1 if it is possible to obtain an $$$i$$$-unstable sequence, or 0 otherwise.",
