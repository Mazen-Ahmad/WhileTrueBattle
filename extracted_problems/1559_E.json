  "statement": "Mocha wants to be an astrologer. There are $$$n$$$ stars which can be seen in Zhijiang, and the brightness of the $$$i$$$-th star is $$$a_i$$$. Mocha considers that these $$$n$$$ stars form a constellation, and she uses $$$(a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n)$$$ to show its state. A state is called mathematical if all of the following three conditions are satisfied: For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i\\le n$$$), $$$a_i$$$ is an integer in the range $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$. $$$\\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^ n a_i \\le m$$$. $$$\\gcd(a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n)=1$$$. Here, $$$\\gcd(a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$. Mocha is wondering how many different mathematical states of this constellation exist. Because the answer may be large, you must find it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Two states $$$(a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n)$$$ and $$$(b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n)$$$ are considered different if there exists $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i\\le n$$$) such that $$$a_i \\ne b_i$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of stars and the upper bound of the sum of the brightness of stars. Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le m$$$) — the range of the brightness of the $$$i$$$-th star.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer — the number of different mathematical states of this constellation, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
