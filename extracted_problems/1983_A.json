  "statement": "An array of integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\cdots,a_n$$$ is beautiful subject to an integer $$$k$$$ if it satisfies the following: The sum of $$$a_{j}$$$ over all $$$j$$$ such that $$$j$$$ is a multiple of $$$k$$$ and $$$1 \\le j \\le n $$$, itself, is a multiple of $$$k$$$. More formally, if $$$\\sum_{k | j} a_{j}$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$ for all $$$1 \\le j \\le n$$$ then the array $$$a$$$ is beautiful subject to $$$k$$$. Here, the notation $$${k|j}$$$ means $$$k$$$ divides $$$j$$$, that is, $$$j$$$ is a multiple of $$$k$$$. Given $$$n$$$, find an array of positive nonzero integers, with each element less than or equal to $$$10^5$$$ that is beautiful subject to all $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$. It can be shown that an answer always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) â€” the size of the array.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the required array as described in the problem statement.",
