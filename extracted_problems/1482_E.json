  "statement": "Alice is visiting New York City. To make the trip fun, Alice will take photos of the city skyline and give the set of photos as a present to Bob. However, she wants to find the set of photos with maximum beauty and she needs your help. There are $$$n$$$ buildings in the city, the $$$i$$$-th of them has positive height $$$h_i$$$. All $$$n$$$ building heights in the city are different. In addition, each building has a beauty value $$$b_i$$$. Note that beauty can be positive or negative, as there are ugly buildings in the city too. A set of photos consists of one or more photos of the buildings in the skyline. Each photo includes one or more buildings in the skyline that form a contiguous segment of indices. Each building needs to be in exactly one photo. This means that if a building does not appear in any photo, or if a building appears in more than one photo, the set of pictures is not valid. The beauty of a photo is equivalent to the beauty $$$b_i$$$ of the shortest building in it. The total beauty of a set of photos is the sum of the beauty of all photos in it. Help Alice to find the maximum beauty a valid set of photos can have.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$), the number of buildings on the skyline. The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le h_i \\le n$$$). The $$$i$$$-th number represents the height of building $$$i$$$. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$). The $$$i$$$-th number represents the beauty of building $$$i$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one number representing the maximum beauty Alice can achieve for a valid set of photos of the skyline.",
