  "statement": "Let's call an array $$$a$$$ beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero): choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$2 \\le i \\le |a| - 1$$$) such that $$$a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}$$$, and replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_{i - 1}$$$. You are given a beautiful array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. What is the minimum number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then output -1 .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). Additional constraints on the input: in every test case, the given array $$$a$$$ is beautiful; the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements you have to remove from the array $$$a$$$ in order for it to stop being beautiful. If it is impossible, then output -1 .",
