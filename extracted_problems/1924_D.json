  "statement": "A sequence of brackets is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters '+' and '1' . For example, sequences '(())()', '()', and '(()(()))' are balanced, while ')(', '(()', and '(()))(' are not. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. You are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$. Find the number of sequences consisting of $$$n$$$ '(' and $$$m$$$ ')' , such that the longest balanced subsequence is of length $$$2 \\cdot k$$$. Since the answer can be large calculate it modulo $$$1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$ ($$$10^9 + 7$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 3 \\cdot 10^3$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^3$$$)",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer â€” the answer to the problem.",
