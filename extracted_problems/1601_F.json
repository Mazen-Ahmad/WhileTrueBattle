  "statement": "Integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (inclusive) were sorted lexicographically (considering integers as strings). As a result, array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ was obtained. Calculate value of $$$(\\sum_{i = 1}^n ((i - a_i) \\mod 998244353)) \\mod 10^9 + 7$$$. $$$x \\mod y$$$ here means the remainder after division $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$. This remainder is always non-negative and doesn't exceed $$$y - 1$$$. For example, $$$5 \\mod 3 = 2$$$, $$$(-1) \\mod 6 = 5$$$.",
