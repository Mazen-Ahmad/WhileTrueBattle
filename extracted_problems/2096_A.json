  "statement": "You are the proud owner of $$$n$$$ sticks. Each stick has an integer length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The lengths of the sticks are distinct . You want to arrange the sticks in a row. There is a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n - 1$$$ that describes the requirements of the arrangement. Specifically, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$: If $$$s_i = \\texttt{<}$$$, then the length of the stick at position $$$i + 1$$$ must be smaller than all sticks before it; If $$$s_i = \\texttt{>}$$$, then the length of the stick at position $$$i + 1$$$ must be larger than all sticks before it. Find any valid arrangement of sticks. We can show that an answer always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of sticks. The second line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n - 1$$$ consisting of characters $$$\\texttt{<}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{>}$$$ — describing the requirements of the arrangement.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$, the $$$a_i$$$ are distinct) — the lengths of the sticks in order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
