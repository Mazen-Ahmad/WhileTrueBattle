  "statement": "For an array $$$b$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, the extreme value of this array is the minimum number of times (possibly, zero) the following operation has to be performed to make $$$b$$$ non-decreasing : Select an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i \\le |b|$$$, where $$$|b|$$$ is the current length of $$$b$$$. Replace $$$b_i$$$ with two elements $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ both are positive integers and $$$x + y = b_i$$$. This way, the array $$$b$$$ changes and the next operation is performed on this modified array. For example, if $$$b = [2, 4, 3]$$$ and index $$$2$$$ gets selected, then the possible arrays after this operation are $$$[2, \\underline{1}, \\underline{3}, 3]$$$, $$$[2, \\underline{2}, \\underline{2}, 3]$$$, or $$$[2, \\underline{3}, \\underline{1}, 3]$$$. And consequently, for this array, this single operation is enough to make it non-decreasing: $$$[2, 4, 3] \\rightarrow [2, \\underline{2}, \\underline{2}, 3]$$$. It's easy to see that every array of positive integers can be made non-decreasing this way. YouKn0wWho has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. Help him find the sum of extreme values of all nonempty subarrays of $$$a$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. If a subarray appears in $$$a$$$ multiple times, its extreme value should be counted the number of times it appears. An array $$$d$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$c$$$ if $$$d$$$ can be obtained from $$$c$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
