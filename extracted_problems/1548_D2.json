  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference from the easy version is that in this version the coordinates can be both odd and even. There are $$$n$$$ fence-posts at distinct coordinates on a plane. It is guaranteed that no three fence posts lie on the same line. There are an infinite number of cows on the plane, one at every point with integer coordinates. Gregor is a member of the Illuminati, and wants to build a triangular fence, connecting $$$3$$$ distinct existing fence posts. A cow strictly inside the fence is said to be enclosed . If there are an odd number of enclosed cows and the area of the fence is an integer , the fence is said to be interesting . Find the number of interesting fences.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 6000$$$), the number of fence posts which Gregor can choose to form the vertices of a fence. Each of the next $$$n$$$ line contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$0 \\le x,y \\le 10^7$$$, where $$$(x,y)$$$ is the coordinate of a fence post. All fence posts lie at distinct coordinates. No three fence posts are on the same line.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer, the number of interesting fences. Two fences are considered different if they are constructed with a different set of three fence posts.",
