  "statement": "Lisa loves playing with the sequences of integers. When she gets a new integer sequence $$$a_i$$$ of length $$$n$$$, she starts looking for all monotone subsequences. A monotone subsequence $$$[l, r]$$$ is defined by two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l < r \\le n$$$) such that $$$\\forall i = l, l+1, \\ldots, r-1: a_i \\le a_{i+1}$$$ or $$$\\forall i = l, l+1, \\ldots, r-1: a_i \\ge a_{i+1}$$$. Lisa considers a sequence $$$a_i$$$ to be boring if there is a monotone subsequence $$$[l, r]$$$ that is as long as her boredom threshold $$$k$$$, that is when $$$r - l + 1 = k$$$. Lucas has a sequence $$$b_i$$$ that he wants to present to Lisa, but the sequence might be boring for Lisa. So, he wants to change some elements of his sequence $$$b_i$$$, so that Lisa does not get bored playing with it. However, Lucas is lazy and wants to change as few elements of the sequence $$$b_i$$$ as possible. Your task is to help Lucas find the required changes.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^6$$$) — the length of the sequence and Lisa's boredom threshold. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 99\\,999$$$) — the original sequence that Lucas has.",
  "outputFormat": "On the first line output an integer $$$m$$$ — the minimal number of elements in $$$b_i$$$ that needs to be changed to make the sequence not boring for Lisa. On the second line output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 100\\,000$$$), so that the sequence of integers $$$a_i$$$ is not boring for Lisa and is different from the original sequence $$$b_i$$$ in exactly $$$m$$$ positions.",
