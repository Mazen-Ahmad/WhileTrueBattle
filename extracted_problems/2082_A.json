  "statement": "A matrix is called binary if all its elements are either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. Ecrade calls a binary matrix $$$A$$$ good if the following two properties hold: The bitwise XOR of all numbers in each row of matrix $$$A$$$ is equal to $$$0$$$. The bitwise XOR of all numbers in each column of matrix $$$A$$$ is equal to $$$0$$$. Ecrade has a binary matrix of size $$$n \\cdot m$$$. He is interested in the minimum number of elements that need to be changed for the matrix to become good . However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 400$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 100$$$). This is followed by $$$n$$$ lines, each containing exactly $$$m$$$ characters consisting only of $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$, describing the elements of Ecrade's matrix. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer, the minimum number of elements that need to be changed.",
