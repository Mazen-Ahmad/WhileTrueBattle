  "statement": "You are given three integers $$$n, a, b$$$. Determine if there exists a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, such that: There are exactly $$$a$$$ integers $$$i$$$ with $$$2 \\le i \\le n-1$$$ such that $$$p_{i-1} < p_i > p_{i+1}$$$ (in other words, there are exactly $$$a$$$ local maximums). There are exactly $$$b$$$ integers $$$i$$$ with $$$2 \\le i \\le n-1$$$ such that $$$p_{i-1} > p_i < p_{i+1}$$$ (in other words, there are exactly $$$b$$$ local minimums). If such permutations exist, find any such permutation.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq a,b \\leq n$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no permutation with the requested properties, output $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, print the permutation that you are found. If there are several such permutations, you may print any of them.",
