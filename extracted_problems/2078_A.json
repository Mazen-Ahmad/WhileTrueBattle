  "statement": "Testify - void (Mournfinale) feat. 星熊南巫 You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, and must perform the following operation until the length of $$$a$$$ becomes $$$1$$$. Choose a positive integer $$$k < |a|$$$ such that $$$\\frac{|a|}{k}$$$ is an integer. Split $$$a$$$ into $$$k$$$ subsequences$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_k$$$ such that: Each element of $$$a$$$ belongs to exactly one subsequence. The length of every subsequence is equal. After this, replace $$$a = \\left[ \\operatorname{avg}(s_1), \\operatorname{avg}(s_2), \\ldots, \\operatorname{avg}(s_k) \\right] $$$, where $$$\\operatorname{avg}(s) = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{|s|} s_i}{|s|}$$$ is the average of all the values in the subsequence. For example, $$$\\operatorname{avg}([1, 2, 1, 1]) = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$$$. Your task is to determine whether there exists a sequence of operations such that after all operations, $$$a = [x]$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, x \\leq 100$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the final desired value. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" YES' \" (without quotes) if there exists such a sequence of operations, and \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yES\" , \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).",
