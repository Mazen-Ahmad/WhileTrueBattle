  "statement": "A binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is given. A binary string is a string consisting only of the characters ' 1 ' and ' 0 '. You can choose an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) and then apply the following operation any number of times: choose $$$k$$$ consecutive characters of the string and invert them, i.e., replace all ' 0 ' with ' 1 ' and vice versa. Using these operations, you need to make all the characters in the string equal to ' 1 '. For example, if $$$n=5$$$, $$$s=00100$$$, you can choose $$$k=3$$$ and proceed as follows: choose the substring from the $$$1$$$-st to the $$$3$$$-rd character and obtain $$$s=\\color{blue}{110}00$$$; choose the substring from the $$$3$$$-rd to the $$$5$$$-th character and obtain $$$s=11\\color{blue}{111}$$$; Find the maximum value of $$$k$$$ for which it is possible to make all the characters in the string equal to ' 1 ' using the described operations. Note that the number of operations required to achieve this is not important.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5000$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters ' 1 ' and ' 0 '. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases in the test does not exceed $$$25 \\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) for which it is possible to obtain a string $$$s$$$ consisting only of the characters ' 1 ' using the described operations.",
