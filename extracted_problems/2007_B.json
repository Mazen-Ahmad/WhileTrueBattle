  "statement": "After receiving yet another integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ at her birthday party, Index decides to perform some operations on it. Formally, there are $$$m$$$ operations that she is going to perform in order. Each of them belongs to one of the two types: $$$\\texttt{+ l r}$$$. Given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ such that $$$l \\leq a_i \\leq r$$$, set $$$a_i := a_i + 1$$$. $$$\\texttt{- l r}$$$. Given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ such that $$$l \\leq a_i \\leq r$$$, set $$$a_i := a_i - 1$$$. For example, if the initial array $$$a = [7, 1, 3, 4, 3]$$$, after performing the operation $$$\\texttt{+} \\space 2 \\space 4$$$, the array $$$a = [7, 1, 4, 5, 4]$$$. Then, after performing the operation $$$\\texttt{-} \\space 1 \\space 10$$$, the array $$$a = [6, 0, 3, 4, 3]$$$. Index is curious about the maximum value in the array $$$a$$$. Please help her find it after each of the $$$m$$$ operations.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array and the number of operations. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the initial array $$$a$$$. Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each line corresponds to the operation, in the following format: $$$\\texttt{c l r}$$$ ($$$c \\in \\{\\texttt +, \\texttt -\\}$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ are integers, $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq 10^9$$$) — the description of the operation. Note that the elements $$$a_i$$$ may not satisfy $$$1\\le a_i\\le 10^9$$$ after some operations, as it is shown in the example. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one single line containing $$$m$$$ integers, with the $$$i$$$-th of them describing the maximum value of the array after the $$$i$$$-th operation.",
