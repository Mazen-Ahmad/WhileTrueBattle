  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n\\ge 4$$$ non-negative integers. You need to perform the following operation on $$$a$$$ until its length becomes $$$1$$$: Select two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1\\le {\\color{red}{ l < r }} \\le |a|$$$), and replace the subarray $$$[a_l,a_{l+1},\\ldots,a_r]$$$ with a single integer $$$\\operatorname{mex}([a_l,a_{l+1},\\ldots,a_r])$$$, where $$$\\operatorname{mex}(b)$$$ denotes the minimum excluded (MEX)$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of the integers in $$$b$$$. In other words, let $$$x=\\operatorname{mex}([a_l,a_{l+1},\\ldots,a_r])$$$, the array $$$a$$$ will become $$$[a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{l-1},x,a_{r+1},a_{r+2},\\ldots,a_{|a|}]$$$. Note that the length of $$$a$$$ decreases by $$$(r-l)$$$ after this operation. Serval wants the final element in $$$a$$$ to be $$$0$$$. Help him! More formally, you have to find a sequence of operations, such that after performing these operations in order, the length of $$$a$$$ becomes $$$1$$$, and the final element in $$$a$$$ is $$$0$$$. It can be shown that at least one valid operation sequence exists under the constraints of the problem, and the length of any valid operation sequence does not exceed $$$n$$$. Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_k$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4\\le n\\le 5000$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\\le a_i\\le n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\le k\\le n$$$) in the first line of output — the length of the operation sequence. Then, output $$$k$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th line containing two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1\\le l_i<r_i\\le |a|$$$) — the two indices you choose in the $$$i$$$-th operation, where $$$|a|$$$ denotes the length of the array before this operation. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.",
