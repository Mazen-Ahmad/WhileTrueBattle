  "statement": "Positive integer $$$x$$$ is called divisor of positive integer $$$y$$$, if $$$y$$$ is divisible by $$$x$$$ without remainder. For example, $$$1$$$ is a divisor of $$$7$$$ and $$$3$$$ is not divisor of $$$8$$$. We gave you an integer $$$d$$$ and asked you to find the smallest positive integer $$$a$$$, such that $$$a$$$ has at least $$$4$$$ divisors; difference between any two divisors of $$$a$$$ is at least $$$d$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 3000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\leq d \\leq 10000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print one integer $$$a$$$ — the answer for this test case.",
