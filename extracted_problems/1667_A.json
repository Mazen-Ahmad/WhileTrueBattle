  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers, and an array $$$b$$$, with length $$$n$$$. Initially $$$b_i=0$$$ for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. In one move you can choose an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$), and add $$$a_i$$$ to $$$b_i$$$ or subtract $$$a_i$$$ from $$$b_i$$$. What is the minimum number of moves needed to make $$$b$$$ increasing (that is, every element is strictly greater than every element before it)?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 5000$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) â€” the elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
