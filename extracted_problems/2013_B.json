  "statement": "Eralim, being the mafia boss, manages a group of $$$n$$$ fighters. Fighter $$$i$$$ has a rating of $$$a_i$$$. Eralim arranges a tournament of $$$n - 1$$$ battles, in each of which two not yet eliminated fighters $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ( $$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$ ) are chosen, and as a result of the battle, fighter $$$i$$$ is eliminated from the tournament, and the rating of fighter $$$j$$$ is reduced by the rating of fighter $$$i$$$. That is, $$$a_j$$$ is decreased by $$$a_i$$$. Note that fighter $$$j$$$'s rating can become negative. The fighters indexes do not change. Eralim wants to know what maximum rating the last remaining fighter can preserve if he chooses the battles optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of fighters. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the ratings of the fighters. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, output a single integer — the maximum rating that the last remaining fighter can preserve.",
