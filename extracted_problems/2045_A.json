  "statement": "You are playing a word game using a standard set of $$$26$$$ uppercase English letters: A â€” Z . In this game, you can form vowels and consonants as follows. The letters A , E , I , O , and U can only form a vowel. The letter Y can form either a vowel or a consonant. Each of the remaining letters other than A , E , I , O , U , and Y can only form a consonant. The string NG can form a single consonant when concatenated together. Denote a syllable as a concatenation of a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant in that order. A word is a concatenation of one or more syllables. You are given a string $$$S$$$ and you want to create a word from it. You are allowed to delete zero or more letters from $$$S$$$ and rearrange the remaining letters to form the word. Find the length of the longest word that can be created, or determine if no words can be created.",
