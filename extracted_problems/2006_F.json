  "statement": "Sadly, Dora poured the paint when painting the class mural. Dora considers the mural as the matrix $$$b$$$ of size $$$n \\times n$$$. Initially, $$$b_{i,j} = 0$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$. Dora has only two brushes which have two different colors. In one operation, she can paint the matrix with one of two brushes: The first brush has color $$$1$$$ on it and can paint one column of the matrix. That is, Dora chooses $$$1 \\leq j \\leq n$$$ and makes $$$b_{i,j} := 1$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$; The second brush has color $$$2$$$ on it and can paint one row of the matrix. That is, Dora chooses $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ and makes $$$b_{i,j} := 2$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq j \\leq n$$$. Dora paints the matrix so that the resulting matrix $$$b$$$ contains only $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$. For a matrix $$$b$$$, let $$$f(b)$$$ denote the minimum number of operations needed to turn the initial matrix (containing only $$$0$$$) into $$$b$$$. The beauty of a matrix $$$b$$$ is the number of ways to paint the initial matrix in exactly $$$f(b)$$$ operations to turn it into $$$b$$$. If there's no way to turn the initial matrix into $$$b$$$, the beauty of $$$b$$$ is $$$0$$$. However, Dora made a uniformly random mistake; there's exactly one element different in the matrix $$$a$$$ given to you from the real matrix $$$b$$$. That is, there is exactly one pair $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$a_{i, j} = 3 - b_{i, j}$$$. Please help Dora compute the expected beauty of the real matrix $$$b$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$ (all possible $$$n^2$$$ mistakes have equal probability). Since the size of the matrix is too large, Dora will only tell you the positions of $$$m$$$ elements of color $$$1$$$, and the remaining $$$n^2-m$$$ elements have color $$$2$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq m \\leq \\min(10^6, n^2)$$$) — the size of the matrix and the number of elements of color $$$1$$$. Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each containing two positive integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq n$$$) — denoting that $$$a_{x_i, y_i} = 1$$$. It is guaranteed that if $$$i \\neq j$$$, then $$$(x_i, y_i) \\neq (x_j, y_j)$$$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\\cdot10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the expected beauty of the real matrix $$$b$$$, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
