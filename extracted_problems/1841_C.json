  "statement": "No, not \"random\" numbers. Ranom digits are denoted by uppercase Latin letters from A to E . Moreover, the value of the letter A is $$$1$$$, B is $$$10$$$, C is $$$100$$$, D is $$$1000$$$, E is $$$10000$$$. A Ranom number is a sequence of Ranom digits. The value of the Ranom number is calculated as follows: the values of all digits are summed up, but some digits are taken with negative signs: a digit is taken with negative sign if there is a digit with a strictly greater value to the right of it (not necessarily immediately after it); otherwise, that digit is taken with a positive sign. For example, the value of the Ranom number DAAABDCA is $$$1000 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 10 + 1000 + 100 + 1 = 2088$$$. You are given a Ranom number. You can change no more than one digit in it. Calculate the maximum possible value of the resulting number.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) consisting of uppercase Latin letters from A to E — the Ranom number you are given. The sum of the string lengths over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible value of the number, if you can change no more than one digit in it.",
