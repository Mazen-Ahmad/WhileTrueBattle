  "statement": "A sequence of integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ is called good if $$$max(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m) \\cdot min(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m) \\ge b_1 + b_2 + \\ldots + b_m$$$. A sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is called perfect if every non-empty subsequence of $$$a$$$ is good . YouKn0wWho has two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$M$$$, $$$M$$$ is prime. Help him find the number, modulo $$$M$$$, of perfect sequences $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ such that $$$1 \\le a_i \\le n + 1$$$ for each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. A sequence $$$d$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$c$$$ if $$$d$$$ can be obtained from $$$c$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.",
  "inputFormat": "The first and only line of the input contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$M$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 200$$$; $$$10^8 \\le M \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$M$$$ is prime .",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer â€” the number of perfect sequences modulo $$$M$$$.",
