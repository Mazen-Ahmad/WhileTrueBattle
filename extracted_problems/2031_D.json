  "statement": "Dedicated to pushing himself to his limits, Penchick challenged himself to survive the midday sun in the Arabian Desert! While trekking along a linear oasis, Penchick spots a desert rabbit preparing to jump along a line of palm trees. There are $$$n$$$ trees, each with a height denoted by $$$a_i$$$. The rabbit can jump from the $$$i$$$-th tree to the $$$j$$$-th tree if exactly one of the following conditions is true: $$$j < i$$$ and $$$a_j > a_i$$$: the rabbit can jump backward to a taller tree. $$$j > i$$$ and $$$a_j < a_i$$$: the rabbit can jump forward to a shorter tree. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, determine the maximum height among all trees that the rabbit can reach if it starts from the $$$i$$$-th tree.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of trees. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the height of the trees. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should contain the maximum height among all trees that the rabbit can reach if it starts from the $$$i$$$-th tree.",
