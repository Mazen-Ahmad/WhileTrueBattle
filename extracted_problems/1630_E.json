  "statement": "Given a cyclic array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the value of $$$a$$$ in the $$$i$$$-th position, there may be repeated values . Let us define that a permutation of $$$a$$$ is equal to another permutation of $$$a$$$ if and only if their values are the same for each position $$$i$$$ or we can transform them to each other by performing some cyclic rotation. Let us define for a cyclic array $$$b$$$ its number of components as the number of connected components in a graph, where the vertices are the positions of $$$b$$$ and we add an edge between each pair of adjacent positions of $$$b$$$ with equal values (note that in a cyclic array the first and last position are also adjacents). Find the expected value of components of a permutation of $$$a$$$ if we select it equiprobably over the set of all the different permutations of $$$a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$) — the size of the cyclic array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$-th of them is the value $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$. It is guaranteed that the total number of different permutations of $$$a$$$ is not divisible by $$$M$$$",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single integer — the expected value of components of a permutation of $$$a$$$ if we select it equiprobably over the set of all the different permutations of $$$a$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Formally, let $$$M = 998\\,244\\,353$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.",
