  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin characters. Find the length of the shortest string $$$k$$$ such that several (possibly one) copies of $$$k$$$ can be concatenated together to form a string with the same length as $$$s$$$ and, at most, one different character. More formally, find the length of the shortest string $$$k$$$ such that $$$c = \\underbrace{k + \\cdots + k}_{x\\rm\\ \\text{times}}$$$ for some positive integer $$$x$$$, strings $$$s$$$ and $$$c$$$ has the same length and $$$c_i \\neq s_i$$$ for at most one $$$i$$$ (i.e. there exist $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ such positions).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin characters. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the length of the shortest string $$$k$$$ satisfying the constraints in the statement.",
