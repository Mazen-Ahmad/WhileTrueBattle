  "statement": "Monocarp and Polycarp are playing a computer game. This game features $$$n$$$ bosses for the playing to kill, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. They will fight each boss the following way: Monocarp makes $$$k$$$ attempts to kill the boss; Polycarp makes $$$k$$$ attempts to kill the boss; Monocarp makes $$$k$$$ attempts to kill the boss; Polycarp makes $$$k$$$ attempts to kill the boss; ... Monocarp kills the $$$i$$$-th boss on his $$$a_i$$$-th attempt. Polycarp kills the $$$i$$$-th boss on his $$$b_i$$$-th attempt. After one of them kills the $$$i$$$-th boss, they move on to the $$$(i+1)$$$-st boss. The attempt counters reset for both of them. Once one of them kills the $$$n$$$-th boss, the game ends. Find all values of $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that Monocarp kills all bosses .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of bosses. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the index of attempt Monocarp kills each boss on. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le n$$$) — the index of attempt Polycarp kills each boss on. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print two lines. The first line should contain a single integer $$$\\mathit{cnt}$$$ — the number of values of $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that Monocarp kills all bosses . The second line should contain $$$\\mathit{cnt}$$$ distinct integers — the values of $$$k$$$ themselves.",
