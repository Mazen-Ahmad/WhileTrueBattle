  "statement": "For an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, we define its equality characteristic as the array $$$b_2, b_3, \\dots, b_{n-1}$$$, where $$$b_i = 1$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th element of the array $$$a$$$ is equal to both of its neighbors, and $$$b_i = 0$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th element of the array $$$a$$$ is not equal to at least one of its neighbors. For example, for the array $$$[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]$$$, the equality characteristic will be $$$[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]$$$. You are given the array $$$b_2, b_3, \\dots, b_{n-1}$$$. Your task is to determine whether there exists such an array $$$a$$$ for which the given array is the equality characteristic.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 100$$$); the second line contains $$$n-2$$$ integers $$$b_2, b_3, \\dots, b_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \\le b_i \\le 1$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output YES if the array $$$a$$$ exists, or NO if such an array does not exist. Each letter can be printed in any case.",
