  "statement": "You are given a $$$2 \\times n$$$ grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column be $$$a_{ij}$$$. There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ that can only jump one cell right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell $$$(2, n)$$$. Consider the binary string of length $$$n+1$$$ consisting of numbers written in cells of the path without changing their order. Your goal is to: Find the lexicographically smallest$$$^\\dagger$$$ string you can attain by choosing any available path; Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. $$$^\\dagger$$$ If two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ have the same length, then $$$s$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$t$$$ if and only if in the first position where $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ differ, the string $$$s$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$t$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$a_{11} a_{12} \\ldots a_{1n}$$$ ($$$a_{1i}$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$). The third line of each test case contains a binary string $$$a_{21} a_{22} \\ldots a_{2n}$$$ ($$$a_{2i}$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output two lines: The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; The number of paths that yield this string.",
