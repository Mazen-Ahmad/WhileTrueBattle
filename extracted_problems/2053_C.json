  "statement": "I'm praying for owning a transparent heart; as well as eyes with tears more than enough... — Escape Plan, Brightest Star in the Dark Iris looked at the stars and a beautiful problem emerged in her mind. She is inviting you to solve it so that a meteor shower is believed to form. There are $$$n$$$ stars in the sky, arranged in a row. Iris has a telescope, which she uses to look at the stars. Initially, Iris observes stars in the segment $$$[1, n]$$$, and she has a lucky value of $$$0$$$. Iris wants to look for the star in the middle position for each segment $$$[l, r]$$$ that she observes. So the following recursive procedure is used: First, she will calculate $$$m = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{l+r}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$$. If the length of the segment (i.e. $$$r - l + 1$$$) is even, Iris will divide it into two equally long segments $$$[l, m]$$$ and $$$[m+1, r]$$$ for further observation. Otherwise, Iris will aim the telescope at star $$$m$$$, and her lucky value will increase by $$$m$$$; subsequently, if $$$l \\neq r$$$, Iris will continue to observe two segments $$$[l, m-1]$$$ and $$$[m+1, r]$$$. Iris is a bit lazy. She defines her laziness by an integer $$$k$$$: as the observation progresses, she will not continue to observe any segment $$$[l, r]$$$ with a length strictly less than $$$k$$$. In this case, please predict her final lucky value .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the final lucky value .",
