  "statement": "Mainak has an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. He will do the following operation to this array exactly once : Pick a subsegment of this array and cyclically rotate it by any amount. Formally, he can do the following exactly once: Pick two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, such that $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, and any positive integer $$$k$$$. Repeat this $$$k$$$ times: set $$$a_l=a_{l+1}, a_{l+1}=a_{l+2}, \\ldots, a_{r-1}=a_r, a_r=a_l$$$ (all changes happen at the same time). Mainak wants to maximize the value of $$$(a_n - a_1)$$$ after exactly one such operation. Determine the maximum value of $$$(a_n - a_1)$$$ that he can obtain.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 50$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2000$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 999$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum value of $$$(a_n - a_1)$$$ that Mainak can obtain by doing the operation exactly once .",
