  "statement": "A pair of positive integers $$$(a,b)$$$ is called special if $$$\\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\rfloor = a \\bmod b$$$. Here, $$$\\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\rfloor$$$ is the result of the integer division between $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, while $$$a \\bmod b$$$ is its remainder. You are given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Find the number of special pairs $$$(a,b)$$$ such that $$$1\\leq a \\leq x$$$ and $$$1 \\leq b \\leq y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The only line of the description of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x,y \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print the answer on a single line.",
