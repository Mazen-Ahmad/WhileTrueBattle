  "statement": "Oh no, the ForceCodes servers are running out of memory! Luckily, you can help them out by uploading some of your RAM! You want to upload $$$n$$$ GBs of RAM. Every second, you will upload either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ GB of RAM. However, there is a restriction on your network speed: in any $$$k$$$ consecutive seconds, you can upload only at most $$$1$$$ GB of RAM in total. Find the minimum number of seconds needed to upload $$$n$$$ GBs of RAM!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 100$$$) — the number of GBs that you want to upload and the length of the time window respectively.",
