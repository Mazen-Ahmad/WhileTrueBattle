  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$. You can reorder the characters to form a string $$$t$$$. Define $$$t_{\\mathrm{max}}$$$ to be the lexicographical maximum of $$$t$$$ and $$$t$$$ in reverse order. Given $$$s$$$ determine the lexicographically minimum value of $$$t_{\\mathrm{max}}$$$ over all reorderings $$$t$$$ of $$$s$$$. A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\ne b$$$; in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow. The first and only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq |s| \\leq 10^5$$$). $$$s$$$ consists of only lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print the lexicographically minimum value of $$$t_{\\mathrm{max}}$$$ over all reorderings $$$t$$$ of $$$s$$$.",
