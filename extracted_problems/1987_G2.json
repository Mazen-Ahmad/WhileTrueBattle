  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions are the allowed characters in $$$s$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. You are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You are also given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where each character is either L , R , or ? . For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$: Define $$$l_i$$$ as the largest index $$$j < i$$$ such that $$$p_j > p_i$$$. If there is no such index, $$$l_i := i$$$. Define $$$r_i$$$ as the smallest index $$$j > i$$$ such that $$$p_j > p_i$$$. If there is no such index, $$$r_i := i$$$. Initially, you have an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$) and no edges. Then, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, add one edge to the graph: If $$$s_i =$$$ L , add the edge $$$(i, l_i)$$$ to the graph. If $$$s_i =$$$ R , add the edge $$$(i, r_i)$$$ to the graph. If $$$s_i =$$$ ? , either add the edge $$$(i, l_i)$$$ or the edge $$$(i, r_i)$$$ to the graph at your choice. Find the maximum possible diameter over all connected $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ graphs that you can form. Output $$$-1$$$ if it is not possible to form any connected graphs. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ Let $$$d(s, t)$$$ denote the smallest number of edges on any path between $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. The diameter of the graph is defined as the maximum value of $$$d(s, t)$$$ over all pairs of vertices $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 4 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of $$$p$$$, which are guaranteed to form a permutation. The third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that it consists only of the characters L , R , and ? . It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum possible diameter over all connected graphs that you form, or $$$-1$$$ if it is not possible to form any connected graphs.",
