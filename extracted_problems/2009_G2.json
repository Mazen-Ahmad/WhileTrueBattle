  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, it is guaranteed that $$$r \\geq l+k-1$$$ for all queries. For an arbitrary array $$$b$$$, Yunli can perform the following operation any number of times: Select an index $$$i$$$. Set $$$b_i = x$$$ where $$$x$$$ is any integer she desires ($$$x$$$ is not limited to the interval $$$[1,n]$$$). Denote $$$f(b)$$$ as the minimum number of operations she needs to perform until there exists a consecutive subarray$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of length at least $$$k$$$ in $$$b$$$. Yunli is given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ and asks you $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, you must output $$$\\sum_{j=l+k-1}^{r} f([a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_j])$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$If there exists a consecutive subarray of length $$$k$$$ that starts at index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq |b|-k+1$$$), then $$$b_j = b_{j-1} + 1$$$ for all $$$i < j \\leq i+k-1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array, the length of the consecutive subarray, and the number of queries. The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$). The following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$, $$$r \\geq l+k-1$$$) — the bounds of the query. It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$\\sum_{j=l+k-1}^{r} f([a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_j])$$$ for each query on a new line.",
