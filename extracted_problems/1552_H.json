  "statement": "Let us call a point of the plane admissible if its coordinates are positive integers less than or equal to $$$200$$$. There is an invisible rectangle such that: its vertices are all admissible; its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes; its area is strictly positive. Your task is to guess the perimeter of this rectangle. In order to guess it, you may ask at most $$$4$$$ queries. In each query, you choose a nonempty subset of the admissible points and you are told how many of the chosen points are inside or on the boundary of the invisible rectangle.",
