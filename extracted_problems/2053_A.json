  "statement": "I would use a firework to announce, a wave to bid farewell, and a bow to say thanks: bygones are bygones; not only on the following path will I be walking leisurely and joyfully, but also the footsteps won't halt as time never leaves out flowing; for in the next year, we will meet again. — Cocoly1990, Goodbye 2022 In his dream, Cocoly would go on a long holiday with no worries around him. So he would try out for many new things, such as... being a carpenter. To learn it well, Cocoly decides to become an apprentice of Master, but in front of him lies a hard task waiting for him to solve. Cocoly is given an array $$$a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n$$$. Master calls a set of integers $$$S$$$ stable if and only if, for any possible $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, and $$$w$$$ from the set $$$S$$$ (note that $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, and $$$w$$$ do not necessarily have to be pairwise distinct), sticks of length $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, and $$$w$$$ can form a non-degenerate triangle$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. Cocoly is asked to partition the array $$$a$$$ into several (possibly, $$$1$$$ or $$$n$$$) non-empty continuous subsegments$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$, such that: for each of the subsegments, the set containing all the elements in it is stable . Master wants Cocoly to partition $$$a$$$ in at least two different$$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$ ways. You have to help him determine whether it is possible. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A triangle with side lengths $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ is called non-degenerate if and only if: $$$x + y > z$$$, $$$y + z > x$$$, and $$$z + x > y$$$. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsegment of a sequence $$$c$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$c$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. $$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$Two partitions are considered different if and only if at least one of the following holds: the numbers of continuous subsegments split in two partitions are different; there is an integer $$$k$$$ such that the lengths of the $$$k$$$-th subsegment in two partitions are different.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 200$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 200$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5$$$) — the elements in the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if there are at least two ways to partition $$$a$$$, and $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings $$$\\texttt{yEs}$$$, $$$\\texttt{yes}$$$, $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ will be recognized as positive responses.",
