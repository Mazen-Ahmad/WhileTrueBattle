  "statement": "Olympus City recently launched the production of personal starships. Now everyone on Mars can buy one and fly to other planets inexpensively. Each starship has a number —some positive integer $$$x$$$. Let's define the luckiness of a number $$$x$$$ as the difference between the largest and smallest digits of that number. For example, $$$142857$$$ has $$$8$$$ as its largest digit and $$$1$$$ as its smallest digit, so its luckiness is $$$8-1=7$$$. And the number $$$111$$$ has all digits equal to $$$1$$$, so its luckiness is zero. Hateehc is a famous Martian blogger who often flies to different corners of the solar system. To release interesting videos even faster, he decided to buy himself a starship. When he came to the store, he saw starships with numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusively. While in the store, Hateehc wanted to find a starship with the luckiest number. Since there are a lot of starships in the store, and Hateehc can't program, you have to help the blogger and write a program that answers his question.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$) —the number of test cases. Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains a description of the test case. The description consists of two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^6$$$) — the largest and smallest numbers of the starships in the store.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$t$$$ lines, one line for each test case, containing the luckiest starship number in the store. If there are several ways to choose the luckiest number, output any of them.",
