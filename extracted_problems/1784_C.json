  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, you need to find the answer for every prefix of the monster array. In a computer game, you are fighting against $$$n$$$ monsters. Monster number $$$i$$$ has $$$a_i$$$ health points, all $$$a_i$$$ are integers. A monster is alive while it has at least $$$1$$$ health point. You can cast spells of two types: Deal $$$1$$$ damage to any single alive monster of your choice. Deal $$$1$$$ damage to all alive monsters. If at least one monster dies (ends up with $$$0$$$ health points) as a result of this action, then repeat it (and keep repeating while at least one monster dies every time). Dealing $$$1$$$ damage to a monster reduces its health by $$$1$$$. Spells of type 1 can be cast any number of times, while a spell of type 2 can be cast at most once during the game. For every $$$k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$, answer the following question. Suppose that only the first $$$k$$$ monsters, with numbers $$$1, 2, \\ldots, k$$$, are present in the game. What is the smallest number of times you need to cast spells of type 1 to kill all $$$k$$$ monsters?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of monsters. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — monsters' health points. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$k$$$-th of these integers must be equal to the smallest number of times you need to cast spells of type 1 to kill all $$$k$$$ monsters, if only monsters with numbers $$$1, 2, \\ldots, k$$$ are present in the game.",
