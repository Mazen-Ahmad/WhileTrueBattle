  "statement": "You are given two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of equal length, consisting of only characters 0 and/or 1 ; both strings start with character 0 and end with character 1 . You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose one of the strings and two equal characters in it; then turn all characters between them into those characters. Formally, you choose one of these two strings (let the chosen string be $$$s$$$), then pick two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$1 \\le l < r \\le |s|$$$ and $$$s_l = s_r$$$, then replace every character $$$s_i$$$ such that $$$l < i < r$$$ with $$$s_l$$$. For example, if the chosen string is 010101 , you can transform it into one of the following strings by applying one operation: 000101 if you choose $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 3$$$; 000001 if you choose $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 5$$$; 010001 if you choose $$$l = 3$$$ and $$$r = 5$$$; 010111 if you choose $$$l = 4$$$ and $$$r = 6$$$; 011111 if you choose $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 6$$$; 011101 if you choose $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 4$$$. You have to determine if it's possible to make the given strings equal by applying this operation any number of times.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the string $$$a$$$ ($$$2 \\le |a| \\le 5000$$$), consisting of only characters 0 and/or 1 . the second line contains the string $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \\le |b| \\le 5000$$$), consisting of only characters 0 and/or 1 . Additional constraints on the input: in each test case, $$$|a| = |b|$$$ (the strings have equal length); in each test case, both strings start with 0 and end with 1 ; the total length of all strings $$$a$$$ in all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make the strings equal. Otherwise, print NO . You can print each letter in any register.",
