  "statement": "Since Mansur is tired of making legends, there will be no legends for this task. You are given an array of positive integer numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. The elements of the array can be rearranged in any order. You need to find the smallest possible value of the expression $$$$$$\\gcd(a_1) + \\gcd(a_1, a_2) + \\ldots + \\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n),$$$$$$ where $$$\\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the size of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — the initial array. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. The sum of $$$\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single number on a separate line — the answer to the problem.",
