  "statement": "Due to a shortage of teachers in the senior class of the \"T-generation\", it was decided to have a huge male gorilla conduct exams for the students. However, it is not that simple; to prove his competence, he needs to solve the following problem. For an array $$$b$$$, we define the function $$$f(b)$$$ as the smallest number of the following operations required to make the array $$$b$$$ empty: take two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, such that $$$l \\le r$$$, and let $$$x$$$ be the $$$\\min(b_l, b_{l+1}, \\ldots, b_r)$$$; then remove all such $$$b_i$$$ that $$$l \\le i \\le r$$$ and $$$b_i = x$$$ from the array, the deleted elements are removed, the indices are renumerated. You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$. No more than $$$k$$$ times, you can choose any index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) and any integer $$$p$$$, and replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$p$$$. Help the gorilla to determine the smallest value of $$$f(a)$$$ that can be achieved after such replacements.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each set of input data contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the maximum number of changes, respectively. The second line of each set of input data contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$ itself. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all sets of input data does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each set of input data, output a single integer on a separate line — the smallest possible value of $$$f(a)$$$.",
