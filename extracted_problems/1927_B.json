  "statement": "Polycarp lost the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters, but he still has its trace . The trace of the string $$$s$$$ is an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of such indices $$$j$$$ ($$$j < i$$$) that $$$s_i=s_j$$$. For example, the trace of the string abracadabra is the array [$$$0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4$$$]. Given a trace of a string, find any string $$$s$$$ from which it could have been obtained. The string $$$s$$$ should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a - z .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the lost string. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < n$$$) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given trace , there exists a suitable string $$$s$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a string $$$s$$$ that corresponds to the given trace . If there are multiple such strings $$$s$$$, then output any of them. The string $$$s$$$ should consist of lowercase Latin letters a - z . It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.",
