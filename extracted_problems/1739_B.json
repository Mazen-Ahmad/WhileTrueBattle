  "statement": "For an array of non-negative integers $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$, we construct another array $$$d$$$ as follows: $$$d_1 = a_1$$$, $$$d_i = |a_i - a_{i - 1}|$$$ for $$$2 \\le i \\le n$$$. Your task is to restore the array $$$a$$$ from a given array $$$d$$$, or to report that there are multiple possible arrays.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the size of the arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$d$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le d_i \\le 100$$$) — the elements of the array $$$d$$$. It can be shown that there always exists at least one suitable array $$$a$$$ under these constraints.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the elements of the array $$$a$$$, if there is only one possible array $$$a$$$. Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$.",
