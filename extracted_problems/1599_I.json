  "statement": "You are given an undirected graph of $$$N$$$ nodes and $$$M$$$ edges, $$$E_1, E_2, \\dots E_M$$$. A connected graph is a cactus if each of it's edges belogs to at most one simple cycle. A graph is a desert if each of it's connected components is a cactus. Find the number of pairs $$$(L, R)$$$, ($$$1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq M$$$) such that, if we delete all the edges except for $$$E_L, E_{L+1}, \\dots E_R$$$, the graph is a desert.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$M$$$ ($$$2 \\leq N \\leq 2.5 \\times 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq M \\leq 5 \\times 10^5$$$). Each of the next $$$M$$$ lines contains two integers. The $$$i$$$-th line describes the $$$i$$$-th edge. It contains integers $$$U_i$$$ and $$$V_i$$$, the nodes connected by the $$$i$$$-th edge ($$$E_i=(U_i, V_i)$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$1 \\leq U_i, V_i \\leq N$$$ and $$$U_i \\neq V_i$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "The output contains one integer number â€“ the answer.",
