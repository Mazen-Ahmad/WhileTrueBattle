  "statement": "You are given two permutations $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ and $$$q_1,q_2,\\ldots,q_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. In one operation, you can select two integers $$$1\\leq i,j\\leq n,i\\neq j$$$ and swap $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$. The cost of the operation is $$$\\min (|i-j|,|p_i-p_j|)$$$. Find the minimum cost to make $$$p_i = q_i$$$ hold for all $$$1\\leq i\\leq n$$$ and output a sequence of operations to achieve the minimum cost. A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of input test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of permutations $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq p_i\\leq n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ is a permutation of $$$1,2,\\ldots,n$$$. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$q_1,q_2,\\ldots,q_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq q_i\\leq n$$$) — the permutation $$$q$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$q_1,q_2,\\ldots,q_n$$$ is a permutation of $$$1,2,\\ldots,n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^3$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the total number of operations $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\le k\\le n^2$$$) on the first line. Then output $$$k$$$ lines, each containing two integers $$$i,j$$$ ($$$1\\le i,j\\le n$$$, $$$i\\neq j$$$) representing an operation to swap $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$ in order. It can be shown that no optimal operation sequence has a length greater than $$$n^2$$$.",
