  "statement": "Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets. Alice has $$$a$$$ coins in her wallet, while Bob has $$$b$$$ coins in his wallet. Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each turn, the player will perform the following steps in order : Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. Remove $$$1$$$ coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have $$$0$$$ coins before performing this step. The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" Alice \" if Alice will win the game, and \" Bob \" if Bob will win the game.",
