  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters and a number $$$k$$$. Let's call a string consisting of lowercase English letters beautiful if the number of occurrences of each letter in that string is divisible by $$$k$$$. You are asked to find the lexicographically smallest beautiful string of length $$$n$$$, which is lexicographically greater or equal to string $$$s$$$. If such a string does not exist, output $$$-1$$$. A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\ne b$$$; in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\le T \\le 10\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The next $$$2 \\cdot T$$$ lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines. The first line of the description contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$ and number $$$k$$$ respectively. The second line contains string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output in a separate line lexicographically smallest beautiful string of length $$$n$$$, which is greater or equal to string $$$s$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if such a string does not exist.",
