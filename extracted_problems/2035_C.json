  "statement": "Alya has been given a hard problem. Unfortunately, she is too busy running for student council. Please solve this problem for her. Given an integer $$$n$$$, construct a permutation $$$p$$$ of integers $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ that maximizes the value of $$$k$$$ (which is initially $$$0$$$) after the following process. Perform $$$n$$$ operations, on the $$$i$$$-th operation ($$$i=1, 2, \\dots, n$$$), If $$$i$$$ is odd, $$$k=k\\,\\&\\,p_i$$$, where $$$\\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation . If $$$i$$$ is even, $$$k=k\\,|\\,p_i$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$5\\le n\\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum value of $$$k$$$ in the first line and output the permutation $$$p_1, p_2,\\ldots, p_n$$$ in the second line. If there are multiple such permutations, output any.",
