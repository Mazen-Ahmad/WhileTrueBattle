  "statement": "You are given three points with integer coordinates $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, and $$$x_3$$$ on the $$$X$$$ axis ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq 10$$$). You can choose any point with an integer coordinate $$$a$$$ on the $$$X$$$ axis. Note that the point $$$a$$$ may coincide with $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, or $$$x_3$$$. Let $$$f(a)$$$ be the total distance from the given points to the point $$$a$$$. Find the smallest value of $$$f(a)$$$. The distance between points $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$|a - b|$$$. For example, the distance between points $$$a = 5$$$ and $$$b = 2$$$ is $$$3$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows their descriptions. The single line of each test case contains three integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, and $$$x_3$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq 10$$$) — the coordinates of the points.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the smallest value of $$$f(a)$$$.",
