  "statement": "My orzlers, we can optimize this problem from $$$O(S^3)$$$ to $$$O\\left(T^\\frac{5}{9}\\right)$$$! â€” Spyofgame, founder of Orzlim religion A long time ago, Spyofgame invented the famous array $$$a$$$ ($$$1$$$-indexed) of length $$$n$$$ that contains information about the world and life. After that, he decided to convert it into the matrix $$$b$$$ ($$$0$$$-indexed) of size $$$(n + 1) \\times (n + 1)$$$ which contains information about the world, life and beyond. Spyofgame converted $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$ with the following rules. $$$b_{i,0} = 0$$$ if $$$0 \\leq i \\leq n$$$; $$$b_{0,i} = a_{i}$$$ if $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$; $$$b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} \\oplus b_{i-1,j}$$$ if $$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$. Here $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation . Today, archaeologists have discovered the famous matrix $$$b$$$. However, many elements of the matrix has been lost. They only know the values of $$$b_{i,n}$$$ for $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ (note that these are some elements of the last column , not the last row ). The archaeologists want to know what a possible array of $$$a$$$ is. Can you help them reconstruct any array that could be $$$a$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, \\ldots, b_{n,n}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq b_{i,n} < 2^{30}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "If some array $$$a$$$ is consistent with the information, print a line containing $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. If there are multiple solutions, output any. If such an array does not exist, output $$$-1$$$ instead.",
