  "statement": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. He's going to kill $$$n$$$ monsters, the $$$i$$$-th of them has $$$h_i$$$ health. Monocarp's character has two spells, either of which he can cast an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) and in an arbitrary order: choose exactly two alive monsters and decrease their health by $$$1$$$; choose a single monster and kill it. When a monster's health becomes $$$0$$$, it dies. What's the minimum number of spell casts Monocarp should perform in order to kill all monsters?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of monsters. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le h_i \\le 100$$$) — the health of each monster. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^4$$$.",
