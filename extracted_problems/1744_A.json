  "statement": "An integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is being transformed into an array of lowercase English letters using the following prodecure: While there is at least one number in the array: Choose any number $$$x$$$ from the array $$$a$$$, and any letter of the English alphabet $$$y$$$. Replace all occurrences of number $$$x$$$ with the letter $$$y$$$. For example, if we initially had an array $$$a = [2, 3, 2, 4, 1]$$$, then we could transform it the following way: Choose the number $$$2$$$ and the letter c . After that $$$a = [c, 3, c, 4, 1]$$$. Choose the number $$$3$$$ and the letter a . After that $$$a = [c, a, c, 4, 1]$$$. Choose the number $$$4$$$ and the letter t . After that $$$a = [c, a, c, t, 1]$$$. Choose the number $$$1$$$ and the letter a . After that $$$a = [c, a, c, t, a]$$$. After the transformation all letters are united into a string, in our example we get the string \" cacta \". Having the array $$$a$$$ and the string $$$s$$$ determine if the string $$$s$$$ could be got from the array $$$a$$$ after the described transformation?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers: $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 50$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" YES \", if we can get the string $$$s$$$ from the array $$$a$$$, and \" NO \" otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.",
