Let's call a set of integers $$$S$$$ such that $$$S \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, n\\}$$$ strange , if, for every element $$$i$$$ of $$$S$$$, the following condition is met: for every $$$j \\in [1, i - 1]$$$, if $$$a_j$$$ divides $$$a_i$$$, then $$$j$$$ is also included in $$$S$$$. An empty set is always strange . The cost of the set $$$S$$$ is $$$\\sum\\limits_{i \\in S} b_i$$$. You have to calculate the maximum possible cost of a strange set.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3000$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$). The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\le b_i \\le 10^5$$$).",
