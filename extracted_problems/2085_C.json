  "statement": "You are given two positive integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1\\le x, y\\le 10^9$$$). Find a non-negative integer $$$k\\le 10^{18}$$$, such that $$$(x+k) + (y+k) = (x+k)\\oplus (y+k)$$$ holds$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$, or determine that such an integer does not exist. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1\\le x, y\\le 10^9$$$) — the given integers.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\le k\\le 10^{18}$$$) — the integer you found. Print $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to find such an integer. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.",
