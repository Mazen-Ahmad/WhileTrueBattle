  "statement": "Ntarsis has a box $$$B$$$ with side lengths $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$. It lies in the 3D coordinate plane, extending from $$$(0,0,0)$$$ to $$$(x,y,z)$$$. Ntarsis has a secret box $$$S$$$. He wants to choose its dimensions such that all side lengths are positive integers, and the volume of $$$S$$$ is $$$k$$$. He can place $$$S$$$ somewhere within $$$B$$$ such that: $$$S$$$ is parallel to all axes. every corner of $$$S$$$ lies on an integer coordinate. $$$S$$$ is magical, so when placed at an integer location inside $$$B$$$, it will not fall to the ground. Among all possible ways to choose the dimensions of $$$S$$$, determine the maximum number of distinct locations he can choose to place his secret box $$$S$$$ inside $$$B$$$. Ntarsis does not rotate $$$S$$$ once its side lengths are selected.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line consists of an integer $$$t$$$, the number of test cases ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains four integers $$$x, y, z$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x, y, z \\leq 2000$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq x \\cdot y \\cdot z$$$). It is guaranteed the sum of all $$$x$$$, sum of all $$$y$$$, and sum of all $$$z$$$ do not exceed $$$2000$$$ over all test cases. Note that $$$k$$$ may not fit in a standard 32-bit integer data type .",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the answer as an integer on a new line. If there is no way to select the dimensions of $$$S$$$ so it fits in $$$B$$$, output $$$0$$$.",
