  "statement": "You would like to construct a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, such that the following condition holds: For every pair of indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$s_{i} = s_{j}$$$, the difference of these indices is even, that is, $$$|i - j| \\bmod 2 = 0$$$. Constructing any string is too easy, so you will be given an array $$$c$$$ of $$$26$$$ numbers — the required number of occurrences of each individual letter in the string $$$s$$$. So, for every $$$i \\in [1, 26]$$$, the $$$i$$$-th letter of the Latin alphabet should occur exactly $$$c_i$$$ times. Your task is to count the number of distinct strings $$$s$$$ that satisfy all these conditions. Since the answer can be huge, output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^{4}$$$)— the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. Each test case contains $$$26$$$ integers $$$c_{i}$$$ ($$$0 \\le c_{i} \\le 5 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$)— the elements of the array $$$c$$$. Additional constraints on the input data: The sum of $$$c_{i}$$$ for every test case is positive; The sum of $$$c_{i}$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the number of suitable strings $$$s$$$, taken modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
