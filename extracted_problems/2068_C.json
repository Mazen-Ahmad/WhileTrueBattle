  "statement": "You have $$$n$$$ videos on your watchlist on the popular platform YooCube. The $$$i$$$-th video lasts $$$d_i$$$ minutes. YooCube has recently increased the frequency of their ads. Ads are shown only between videos. After finishing a video, an ad is shown if either of these two conditions is true: three videos have been watched since the last ad; at least $$$k$$$ minutes have passed since the end of the last ad. You want to watch the $$$n$$$ videos in your watchlist. Given that you have just watched an ad, and that you can choose the order of the $$$n$$$ videos, what is the minimum number of ads that you are forced to watch? You can start a new video immediately after the previous video or ad ends, and you don't have to watch any ad after you finish.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000, 1 \\leq k \\leq 30\\,000$$$) — the number of videos in your watchlist and the parameter that determines when ads are shown. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n (1 \\leq d_i \\leq 10\\,000)$$$ — the lengths of the videos. The sum of the values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the minimum number of ads that you need to watch.",
