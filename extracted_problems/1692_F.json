  "statement": "Given an array $$$a$$$ of positive integers with length $$$n$$$, determine if there exist three distinct indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ such that $$$a_i + a_j + a_k$$$ ends in the digit $$$3$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. The sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$t$$$ lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. Output \" YES \" if there exist three distinct indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ satisfying the constraints in the statement, and \" NO \" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \" and \" YES \" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
