  "statement": "Programmer Gleb frequently visits the IT Campus \"NEIMARK\" to participate in programming training sessions. Not only is Gleb a programmer, but he is also a renowned rower, so he covers part of his journey from home to the campus by kayaking along a river. Assume that Gleb starts at point $$$0$$$ and must reach point $$$s$$$ (i.e., travel $$$s$$$ meters along a straight line). To make the challenge tougher, Gleb has decided not to go outside the segment $$$[0, s]$$$. The dimensions of the kayak can be neglected. Gleb is a strong programmer! Initially, his power is $$$k$$$. Gleb's power directly affects the movement of his kayak. If his current power is $$$x$$$, then with one paddle stroke the kayak moves $$$x$$$ meters in the current direction. Gleb can turn around and continue moving in the opposite direction, but such a maneuver is quite challenging, and after each turn, his power decreases by $$$1$$$. The power can never become $$$0$$$ — if his current power is $$$1$$$, then even after turning it remains $$$1$$$. Moreover, Gleb cannot make two turns in a row — after each turn, he must move at least once before making another turn. Similarly, Gleb cannot make a turn immediately after the start — he must first perform a paddle stroke. Gleb wants to reach point $$$s$$$ from point $$$0$$$ without leaving the segment $$$[0, s]$$$ and while preserving as much power as possible. Help him — given the value $$$s$$$ and his initial power $$$k$$$, determine the maximum possible power he can have upon reaching point $$$s$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. A single line of each test case contains two integers $$$s$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 1000$$$, $$$k \\leq s$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum possible power Gleb can have at the end of his journey.",
