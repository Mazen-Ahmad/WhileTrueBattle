  "statement": "Recently, the first-year student Maxim learned about the Collatz conjecture, but he didn't pay much attention during the lecture, so he believes that the following process is mentioned in the conjecture: There is a variable $$$x$$$ and a constant $$$y$$$. The following operation is performed $$$k$$$ times: increase $$$x$$$ by $$$1$$$, then while the number $$$x$$$ is divisible by $$$y$$$, divide it by $$$y$$$. Note that both of these actions are performed sequentially within one operation. For example, if the number $$$x = 16$$$, $$$y = 3$$$, and $$$k = 2$$$, then after one operation $$$x$$$ becomes $$$17$$$, and after another operation $$$x$$$ becomes $$$2$$$, because after adding one, $$$x = 18$$$ is divisible by $$$3$$$ twice. Given the initial values of $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$k$$$, Maxim wants to know what is the final value of $$$x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, k \\le 10^{9}$$$, $$$2 \\le y \\le 10^{9}$$$) — the initial variable, constant and the number of operations.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number obtained after applying $$$k$$$ operations.",
