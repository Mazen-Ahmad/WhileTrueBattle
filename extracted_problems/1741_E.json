  "statement": "The sequence $$$a$$$ is sent over the network as follows: sequence $$$a$$$ is split into segments (each element of the sequence belongs to exactly one segment, each segment is a group of consecutive elements of sequence); for each segment, its length is written next to it, either to the left of it or to the right of it; the resulting sequence $$$b$$$ is sent over the network. For example, we needed to send the sequence $$$a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]$$$. Suppose it was split into segments as follows: $$$[\\color{red}{1}] + [\\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}] + [\\color{green}{2, 3}]$$$. Then we could have the following sequences: $$$b = [1, \\color{red}{1}, 3, \\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, \\color{green}{2, 3}, 2]$$$, $$$b = [\\color{red}{1}, 1, 3, \\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, 2, \\color{green}{2, 3}]$$$, $$$b = [\\color{red}{1}, 1, \\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, 3, 2, \\color{green}{2, 3}]$$$, $$$b = [\\color{red}{1}, 1,\\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, 3, \\color{green}{2, 3}, 2]$$$. If a different segmentation had been used, the sent sequence might have been different. The sequence $$$b$$$ is given. Could the sequence $$$b$$$ be sent over the network? In other words, is there such a sequence $$$a$$$ that converting $$$a$$$ to send it over the network could result in a sequence $$$b$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of the test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the sequence $$$b$$$. The second line of test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the sequence $$$b$$$ itself. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print on a separate line: YES if sequence $$$b$$$ could be sent over the network, that is, if sequence $$$b$$$ could be obtained from some sequence $$$a$$$ to send $$$a$$$ over the network. NO otherwise. You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will be recognized as positive response).",
