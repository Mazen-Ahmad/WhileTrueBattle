  "statement": "For an integer sequence $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$$$, we define $$$f(a)$$$ as the length of the longest subsequence$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$a$$$ that is a palindrome$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$. Let $$$g(a)$$$ represent the number of subsequences of length $$$f(a)$$$ that are palindromes. In other words, $$$g(a)$$$ counts the number of palindromic subsequences in $$$a$$$ that have the maximum length. Given an integer $$$n$$$, your task is to find any sequence $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers that satisfies the following conditions: $$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. $$$g(a) > n$$$ It can be proven that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example, $$$[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[5, 5, 5, 5]$$$, and $$$[4, 3, 3, 4]$$$ are palindromes, while $$$[1, 2]$$$ and $$$[2, 3, 3, 3, 3]$$$ are not.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$\\color{red}{6} \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the sequence. Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, representing an array that satisfies the conditions. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.",
