  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. You are also given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of size $$$n$$$. It is known that for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq k$$$. Define a two-dimensional array $$$b$$$ of size $$$n \\times n$$$ as follows: $$$b_{i, j} = \\min(a_i, a_j)$$$. Represent array $$$b$$$ as a square, where the upper left cell is $$$b_{1, 1}$$$, rows are numbered from top to bottom from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and columns are numbered from left to right from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Let the color of a cell be the number written in it (for a cell with coordinates $$$(i, j)$$$, this is $$$b_{i, j}$$$). For each color from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, find the smallest rectangle in the array $$$b$$$ containing all cells of this color. Output the sum of width and height of this rectangle.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, k \\leq 10^5$$$) — the size of array $$$a$$$ and the number of colors. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq k$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$k$$$ numbers: the sums of width and height of the smallest rectangle containing all cells of a color, for each color from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$.",
