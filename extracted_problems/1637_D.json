  "statement": "You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) and swap $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. Let's define the cost of the array $$$a$$$ as $$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=i + 1}^{n} (a_i + a_j)^2$$$. Similarly, the cost of the array $$$b$$$ is $$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=i + 1}^{n} (b_i + b_j)^2$$$. Your task is to minimize the total cost of two arrays.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test case consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 40$$$) — the number of test cases. The following is a description of the input data sets. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the length of both arrays. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$$$) — elements of the first array. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 100$$$) — elements of the second array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100$$$.",
