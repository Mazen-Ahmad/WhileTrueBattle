  "statement": "If it was so, then let's make it a deal... — MayDay, Gentleness Even after copying the paintings from famous artists for ten years, unfortunately, Eric is still unable to become a skillful impressionist painter. He wants to forget something, but the white bear phenomenon just keeps hanging over him. Eric still remembers $$$n$$$ pieces of impressions in the form of an integer array. He records them as $$$w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n$$$. However, he has a poor memory of the impressions. For each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, he can only remember that $$$l_i \\leq w_i \\leq r_i$$$. Eric believes that impression $$$i$$$ is unique if and only if there exists a possible array $$$w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n$$$ such that $$$w_i \\neq w_j$$$ holds for all $$$1 \\leq j \\leq n$$$ with $$$j \\neq i$$$. Please help Eric determine whether impression $$$i$$$ is unique for every $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, independently for each $$$i$$$. Perhaps your judgment can help rewrite the final story.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of impressions. Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th containing two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq 2\\cdot n$$$) — the minimum possible value and the maximum possible value of $$$w_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$: for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, if impression $$$i$$$ is unique , $$$s_i=\\texttt{1}$$$; otherwise, $$$s_i=\\texttt{0}$$$. Do not output spaces.",
