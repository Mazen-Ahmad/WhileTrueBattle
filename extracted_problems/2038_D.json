  "statement": "You are given an array $$$[a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n]$$$ consisting of integers between $$$0$$$ and $$$10^9$$$. You have to split this array into several segments (possibly one) in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one segment. Let the first segment be the array $$$[a_{l_1}, a_{l_1 + 1}, \\ldots, a_{r_1}]$$$, the second segment be $$$[a_{l_2}, a_{l_2+ 1}, \\ldots, a_{r_2}]$$$, ..., the last segment be $$$[a_{l_k}, a_{l_k+ 1}, \\ldots, a_{r_k}]$$$. Since every element should belong to exactly one array, $$$l_1 = 1$$$, $$$r_k = n$$$, and $$$r_i + 1 = l_{i+1}$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k-1$$$. The split should meet the following condition: $$$f([a_{l_1}, a_{l_1 + 1}, \\ldots, a_{r_1}]) \\le f([a_{l_2}, a_{l_2+ 1}, \\ldots, a_{r_2}]) \\le \\dots \\le f([a_{l_k}, a_{l_k+1}, \\ldots, a_{r_k}])$$$, where $$$f(a)$$$ is the bitwise OR of all elements of the array $$$a$$$. Calculate the number of ways to split the array, and print it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Two ways are considered different if the sequences $$$[l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, \\ldots, l_k, r_k]$$$ denoting the splits are different.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10 ^9$$$) — the elements of the given array.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer — the number of ways to split the array, taken modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
