  "statement": "This time Baby Ehab will only cut and not stick. He starts with a piece of paper with an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ written on it, and then he does the following: he picks a range $$$(l, r)$$$ and cuts the subsegment $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ out, removing the rest of the array. he then cuts this range into multiple subranges. to add a number theory spice to it, he requires that the elements of every subrange must have their product equal to their least common multiple (LCM) . Formally, he partitions the elements of $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ into contiguous subarrays such that the product of every subarray is equal to its LCM. Now, for $$$q$$$ independent ranges $$$(l, r)$$$, tell Baby Ehab the minimum number of subarrays he needs.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n,q \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) — the endpoints of this query's interval.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print its answer on a new line.",
