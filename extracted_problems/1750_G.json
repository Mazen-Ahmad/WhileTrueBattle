  "statement": "We call an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ fancy if for each $$$1 < i \\le n$$$ it holds that $$$a_i = a_{i-1} + 1$$$. Let's call $$$f(p)$$$ applied to a permutation$$$^\\dagger$$$ of length $$$n$$$ as the minimum number of subarrays it can be partitioned such that each one of them is fancy. For example $$$f([1,2,3]) = 1$$$, while $$$f([3,1,2]) = 2$$$ and $$$f([3,2,1]) = 3$$$. Given $$$n$$$ and a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, we define a permutation $$$p'$$$ of length $$$n$$$ to be $$$k$$$-special if and only if: $$$p'$$$ is lexicographically smaller$$$^\\ddagger$$$ than $$$p$$$, and $$$f(p') = k$$$. Your task is to count for each $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$ the number of $$$k$$$-special permutations modulo $$$m$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). $$$^\\ddagger$$$ A permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a permutation $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ if and only if the following holds: in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the permutation $$$a$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2000$$$, $$$10 \\le m \\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the permutation and the required modulo. The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$k$$$-th integer is the number of $$$k$$$-special permutations modulo $$$m$$$.",
