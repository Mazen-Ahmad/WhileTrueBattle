These meals typically include a variety of vegetables, protein, and rice, providing a well-rounded diet. With numerous options available at local self-service restaurants, they are a popular choice for those looking for a quick, healthy lunch. There are five Taiwanese self-service restaurants numbered from 1 to 5. You plan to visit a different restaurant each day from Monday to Friday to pack a boxed meal for lunch. You've already visited one restaurant from Monday to Thursday, each time visiting a different one. Now, it's Friday, and you want to visit the last remaining restaurant that you haven't been to yet this week.
