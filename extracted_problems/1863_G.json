  "statement": "You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). You can perform the following operation several (possibly, zero) times: pick an arbitrary $$$i$$$ and perform swap $$$(a_i, a_{a_i})$$$. How many distinct arrays is it possible to attain? Output the answer modulo $$$(10^9 + 7)$$$.",
