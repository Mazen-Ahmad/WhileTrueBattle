  "statement": "An array is called good if for any element $$$x$$$ that appears in this array, it holds that $$$x$$$ appears at least twice in this array. For example, the arrays $$$[1, 2, 1, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 3]$$$, and $$$[1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4]$$$ are good, while the arrays $$$[1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 1]$$$, and $$$[2, 3, 4, 4]$$$ are not good. Milya has two good arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. She can rearrange the elements in array $$$a$$$ in any way. After that, she obtains an array $$$c$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where $$$c_i = a_i + b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$). Determine whether Milya can rearrange the elements in array $$$a$$$ such that there are at least $$$3$$$ distinct elements in array $$$c$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the length of the arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$b$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$«$$$ YES $$$»$$$ (without quotes) if it is possible to obtain at least $$$3$$$ distinct elements in array $$$c$$$, and $$$«$$$ NO $$$»$$$ otherwise. You can output each letter in any case (for example, $$$«$$$ YES $$$»$$$, $$$«$$$ Yes $$$»$$$, $$$«$$$ yes $$$»$$$, $$$«$$$ yEs $$$»$$$ will be recognized as a positive answer).",
