  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Let's define two operations you can apply on the string: remove the first character of the string; remove the second character of the string. Your task is to find the number of distinct non-empty strings that can be generated by applying the given operations on the initial string any number of times (possibly zero), in any order.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the string. The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$. It is guaranteed that the string only contains lowercase letters of the English alphabet. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer: the number of distinct non-empty strings you can get.",
