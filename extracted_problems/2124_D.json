  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$, and an integer $$$k$$$. You may perform the following operation any number of times: Select two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ $$$(1 \\le l \\le r \\le |a|)$$$ such that $$$r-l+1 \\geq k$$$. Then, select an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$l\\leq i \\leq r$$$ where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$k$$$-th smallest number out of the subarray $$$[a_l,a_{l+1},\\ldots,a_r]$$$. If there are multiple possible $$$i$$$, you may select any. For example, consider $$$a = [1, 2, 2, 1, 3], l = 1, r = 5$$$ and $$$k = 3$$$, the possible candidates of $$$i$$$ are indices $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$. Then, delete $$$a_i$$$ from $$$a$$$, concatenating the remaining parts of the array. Determine if it is possible to get an array that is a palindrome$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ after any number of operations. Note that an empty array is considered a palindrome. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$b=[b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_m]$$$ is a palindrome if for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq m$$$, $$$b_i=b_{m+1-i}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — denoting the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output YES if it is possible to create a palindrome, and NO otherwise. You can output in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\" , \"yes\" , \"Yes\" , and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",
