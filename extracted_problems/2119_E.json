  "statement": "wowaka & Hatsune Miku - Tosenbo You are given a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n-1$$$ and a sequence $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose an index $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ and increment $$$b_i$$$ by $$$1$$$ (i.e., set $$$b_i \\leftarrow b_i + 1$$$). Your goal is to perform the minimum number of operations such that for every $$$1 \\le i \\le n-1$$$, the condition $$$b_i \\, \\& \\, b_{i+1} = a_i$$$ holds, where $$$\\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation . If it is impossible to satisfy the condition, report it as well.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < 2^{29}$$$). The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le b_i < 2^{29}$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, you need to output only one integer. If the goal can be achieved, output one integer â€” the minimum number of operations required. Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$.",
