  "statement": "Consider the array $$$a$$$ composed of all the integers in the range $$$[l, r]$$$. For example, if $$$l = 3$$$ and $$$r = 7$$$, then $$$a = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$$$. Given $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$k$$$, is it possible for $$$\\gcd(a)$$$ to be greater than $$$1$$$ after doing the following operation at most $$$k$$$ times? Choose $$$2$$$ numbers from $$$a$$$. Permanently remove one occurrence of each of them from the array. Insert their product back into $$$a$$$. $$$\\gcd(b)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The input for each test case consists of a single line containing $$$3$$$ non-negative integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq 10^9, \\enspace 0 \\leq k \\leq r - l$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" YES \" if it is possible to have the GCD of the corresponding array greater than $$$1$$$ by performing at most $$$k$$$ operations, and \" NO \" otherwise (case insensitive).",
