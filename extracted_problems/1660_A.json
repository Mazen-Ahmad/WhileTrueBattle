  "statement": "Vasya decided to go to the grocery store. He found in his wallet $$$a$$$ coins of $$$1$$$ burle and $$$b$$$ coins of $$$2$$$ burles. He does not yet know the total cost of all goods, so help him find out $$$s$$$ ($$$s > 0$$$): the minimum positive integer amount of money he cannot pay without change or pay at all using only his coins. For example, if $$$a=1$$$ and $$$b=1$$$ (he has one $$$1$$$-burle coin and one $$$2$$$-burle coin), then: he can pay $$$1$$$ burle without change, paying with one $$$1$$$-burle coin, he can pay $$$2$$$ burle without change, paying with one $$$2$$$-burle coin, he can pay $$$3$$$ burle without change by paying with one $$$1$$$-burle coin and one $$$2$$$-burle coin, he cannot pay $$$4$$$ burle without change (moreover, he cannot pay this amount at all). So for $$$a=1$$$ and $$$b=1$$$ the answer is $$$s=4$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. The description of each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i, b_i \\le 10^8$$$) — the number of $$$1$$$-burle coins and $$$2$$$-burles coins Vasya has respectively.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, on a separate line print one integer $$$s$$$ ($$$s > 0$$$): the minimum positive integer amount of money that Vasya cannot pay without change or pay at all.",
