  "statement": "Ali and Bahamin decided to spend their summer vacation on the beautiful southern coasts of Iran. They also agreed to do some shopping during the trip — but instead of setting a fixed budget, they decided to determine how much they would spend by playing a game. The game is played on two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, each containing $$$n$$$ integers. The game will last for $$$k$$$ rounds. In one round: First, Ali selects two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$$$); Then, Bahamin rearranges the four integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_j$$$, $$$b_i$$$, and $$$b_j$$$ arbitrarily . Note that Bahamin can swap numbers between two arrays. He can also keep the two arrays unchanged. After all the $$$k$$$ rounds, the value of the game is defined as $$$v=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} |a_i-b_i|$$$. Ali and Bahamin will spend exactly $$$v$$$ coins during their trip. However, their goals are quite different: Ali wants to spend as little as possible, that is, to minimize $$$v$$$; Bahamin wants to spend as much as possible, that is, to maximize $$$v$$$. You have to find the final amount of coins they will spend if both Ali and Bahamin play optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and the number of rounds. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of $$$a$$$. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the final amount of coins they will spend if both Ali and Bahamin play optimally.",
