  "statement": "You are given a binary string of length $$$n$$$. You have exactly $$$k$$$ moves. In one move, you must select a single bit. The state of all bits except that bit will get flipped ($$$0$$$ becomes $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$ becomes $$$0$$$). You need to output the lexicographically largest string that you can get after using all $$$k$$$ moves. Also, output the number of times you will select each bit. If there are multiple ways to do this, you may output any of them. A binary string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically larger than a binary string $$$b$$$ of the same length, if and only if the following holds: in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ contains a $$$1$$$, and the string $$$b$$$ contains a $$$0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case has two lines. The first line has two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$0 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$). The second line has a binary string of length $$$n$$$, each character is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output two lines. The first line should contain the lexicographically largest string you can obtain. The second line should contain $$$n$$$ integers $$$f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_n$$$, where $$$f_i$$$ is the number of times the $$$i$$$-th bit is selected. The sum of all the integers must be equal to $$$k$$$.",
