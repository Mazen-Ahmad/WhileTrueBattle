  "statement": "William has array of $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. He can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times : Pick any two items from array $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ must be a multiple of $$$2$$$ $$$a_i = \\frac{a_i}{2}$$$ $$$a_j = a_j \\cdot 2$$$ Help William find the maximal sum of array elements, which he can get by performing the sequence of operations described above.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\le n \\le 15)$$$, the number of elements in William's array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\le a_i < 16)$$$, the contents of William's array.",
