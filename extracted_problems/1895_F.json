  "statement": "Let's call an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers fancy if the following conditions hold: at least one from the numbers $$$x$$$, $$$x + 1$$$, ..., $$$x+k-1$$$ appears in the array; consecutive elements of the array differ by at most $$$k$$$ (i.e. $$$|a_i-a_{i-1}| \\le k$$$ for each $$$i \\in [2, n]$$$). You are given $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$. Your task is to calculate the number of fancy arrays of length $$$n$$$. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 50$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 10^9$$$; $$$0 \\le x \\le 40$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the number of fancy arrays of length $$$n$$$, taken modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
