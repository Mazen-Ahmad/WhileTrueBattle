  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. Consider $$$S$$$ as a set of segments satisfying the following conditions. Each element of $$$S$$$ should be in form $$$[x, y]$$$, where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive, and $$$x \\leq y$$$. No two segments in $$$S$$$ intersect with each other. Two segments $$$[a, b]$$$ and $$$[c, d]$$$ intersect if and only if there exists an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$a \\leq x \\leq b$$$ and $$$c \\leq x \\leq d$$$. For each $$$[x, y]$$$ in $$$S$$$, $$$a_x+a_{x+1}+ \\ldots +a_y \\geq 0$$$. The length of the segment $$$[x, y]$$$ is defined as $$$y-x+1$$$. $$$f(S)$$$ is defined as the sum of the lengths of every element in $$$S$$$. In a formal way, $$$f(S) = \\sum_{[x, y] \\in S} (y - x + 1)$$$. Note that if $$$S$$$ is empty, $$$f(S)$$$ is $$$0$$$. What is the maximum $$$f(S)$$$ among all possible $$$S$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The next line is followed by $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer, the maximum $$$f(S)$$$ among every possible $$$S$$$.",
