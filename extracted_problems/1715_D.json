  "statement": "The Narrator has an integer array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, but he will only tell you the size $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ statements, each of them being three integers $$$i, j, x$$$, which means that $$$a_i \\mid a_j = x$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation . Find the lexicographically smallest array $$$a$$$ that satisfies all the statements. An array $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $$$b$$$ of the same length if and only if the following holds: in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the array $$$a$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "In the first line you are given with two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). In the next $$$q$$$ lines you are given with three integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, $$$0 \\le x < 2^{30}$$$) — the statements. It is guaranteed that all $$$q$$$ statements hold for at least one array.",
  "outputFormat": "On a single line print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < 2^{30}$$$) — array $$$a$$$.",
