  "statement": "Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a drawing and attract her attention. As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size $$$n \\times n$$$, in which some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least $$$k$$$ diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size $$$n \\times n$$$ has a total of $$$4n - 2$$$ diagonals. Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the minimum number of cells he needs to color.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^8$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 4n - 2$$$) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that need to be colored.",
