  "statement": "Tanchiky & Siromaru - Crystal Gravity ⠀ You are given two strings $$$s$$$, $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, respectively. Both strings consist of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Count the triples $$$(x, y, z)$$$ of strings such that the following conditions are true: $$$s = x+y+z$$$ (the symbol $$$+$$$ represents the concatenation); $$$t = x+\\underbrace{ y+\\dots+y }_{k \\text{ times}} + z$$$ for some integer $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n < m \\leq 10^7$$$) — the length of the strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, respectively. The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The third line contains the string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$, consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet.",
