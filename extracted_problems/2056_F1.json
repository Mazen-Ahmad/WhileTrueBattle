  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, the constraints on $$$t$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$m$$$ are lower. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. A sequence $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers is called good if the following condition holds: Let $$$\\text{cnt}_x$$$ be the number of occurrences of $$$x$$$ in sequence $$$a$$$. For all pairs $$$0 \\le i < j < m$$$, at least one of the following has to be true: $$$\\text{cnt}_i = 0$$$, $$$\\text{cnt}_j = 0$$$, or $$$\\text{cnt}_i \\le \\text{cnt}_j$$$. In other words, if both $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are present in sequence $$$a$$$, then the number of occurrences of $$$i$$$ in $$$a$$$ is less than or equal to the number of occurrences of $$$j$$$ in $$$a$$$. You are given integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. Calculate the value of the bitwise XOR of the median$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of all good sequences $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ with $$$0\\le a_i < m$$$. Note that the value of $$$n$$$ can be very large, so you are given its binary representation instead. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The median of a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is defined as the $$$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$$-th smallest value in the sequence.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 50$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le 200$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 500$$$) — the number of bits in $$$n$$$ and the upper bound on the elements in sequence $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains a binary string of length $$$k$$$ — the binary representation of $$$n$$$ with no leading zeros. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$200$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer representing the bitwise XOR of the median of all good sequences $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ where $$$0\\le a_i < m$$$.",
