  "statement": "Once, Kirei stealthily infiltrated the trap-filled estate of the Ainzbern family but was discovered by Kiritugu's familiar. Assessing his strength, Kirei decided to retreat. The estate is represented as a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices, with the root at vertex $$$1$$$. Each vertex of the tree has a number $$$a_i$$$ recorded, which represents the danger of vertex $$$i$$$. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. For a successful retreat, Kirei must compute the threat value for each vertex. The threat of a vertex is equal to the maximum alternating sum along the vertical path starting from that vertex. The alternating sum along the vertical path starting from vertex $$$i$$$ is defined as $$$a_i - a_{p_i} + a_{p_{p_i}} - \\ldots$$$, where $$$p_i$$$ is the parent of vertex $$$i$$$ on the path to the root (to vertex $$$1$$$). For example, in the tree below, vertex $$$4$$$ has the following vertical paths: $$$[4]$$$ with an alternating sum of $$$a_4 = 6$$$; $$$[4, 3]$$$ with an alternating sum of $$$a_4 - a_3 = 6 - 2 = 4$$$; $$$[4, 3, 2]$$$ with an alternating sum of $$$a_4 - a_3 + a_2 = 6 - 2 + 5 = 9$$$; $$$[4, 3, 2, 1]$$$ with an alternating sum of $$$a_4 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = 6 - 2 + 5 - 4 = 5$$$. The dangers of the vertices are indicated in red. Help Kirei compute the threat values for all vertices and escape the estate.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following describes the test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the dangers of the vertices. The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain the numbers $$$v, u$$$ ($$$1 \\le v, u \\le n$$$, $$$v \\neq u$$$) — the description of the edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. It is also guaranteed that the given set of edges forms a tree.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers — the threat of each vertex.",
