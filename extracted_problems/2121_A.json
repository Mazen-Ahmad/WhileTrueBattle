  "statement": "You are given an array of distinct integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ and an integer $$$s$$$. Initially, you are at position $$$pos = s$$$ on the $$$X$$$ axis. In one step, you can perform exactly one of the following two actions: Move from position $$$pos$$$ to position $$$pos + 1$$$. Move from position $$$pos$$$ to position $$$pos - 1$$$. A sequence of steps will be considered successful if, during the entire journey, you visit each position $$$x_i$$$ on the $$$X$$$ axis at least once. Note that the initial position $$$pos = s$$$ is also considered visited. Your task is to determine the minimum number of steps in any successful sequence of steps.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10$$$, $$$1 \\leq s \\leq 100$$$) — the number of positions to visit and the starting position. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq 100$$$). It is guaranteed that for all $$$1 \\leq i < n$$$, it holds that $$$x_i < x_{i + 1}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum number of steps in any successful sequence of steps.",
