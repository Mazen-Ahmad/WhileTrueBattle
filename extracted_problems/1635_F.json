  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ weighted points on the $$$OX$$$-axis. The coordinate and the weight of the $$$i$$$-th point is $$$x_i$$$ and $$$w_i$$$, respectively. All points have distinct coordinates and positive weights. Also, $$$x_i < x_{i + 1}$$$ holds for any $$$1 \\leq i < n$$$. The weighted distance between $$$i$$$-th point and $$$j$$$-th point is defined as $$$|x_i - x_j| \\cdot (w_i + w_j)$$$, where $$$|val|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$val$$$. You should answer $$$q$$$ queries, where the $$$i$$$-th query asks the following: Find the minimum weighted distance among all pairs of distinct points among the points in subarray $$$[l_i,r_i]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains 2 integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ $$$(2 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5; 1 \\leq q \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5)$$$ — the number of points and the number of queries. Then, $$$n$$$ lines follows, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$w_i$$$ $$$(-10^9 \\leq x_i \\leq 10^9; 1 \\leq w_i \\leq 10^9)$$$ — the coordinate and the weight of the $$$i$$$-th point. It is guaranteed that the points are given in the increasing order of $$$x$$$. Then, $$$q$$$ lines follows, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ $$$(1 \\leq l_i < r_i \\leq n)$$$ — the given subarray of the $$$i$$$-th query.",
