  "statement": "RSJ has a sequence $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and an integer $$$s$$$. For each of $$$a_2,a_3, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$$$, he chose a pair of non-negative integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ such that $$$x_i+y_i=a_i$$$ and $$$(x_i-s) \\cdot (y_i-s) \\geq 0$$$. Now he is interested in the value $$$$$$F = a_1 \\cdot x_2+y_2 \\cdot x_3+y_3 \\cdot x_4 + \\ldots + y_{n - 2} \\cdot x_{n-1}+y_{n-1} \\cdot a_n.$$$$$$ Please help him find the minimum possible value $$$F$$$ he can get by choosing $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ optimally. It can be shown that there is always at least one valid way to choose them.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$s$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$0 \\le s \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
