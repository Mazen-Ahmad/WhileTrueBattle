  "statement": "There is an apartment consisting of $$$n$$$ rooms, each with its light initially turned off . To control the lights in these rooms, the owner of the apartment decided to install chips in the rooms so that each room has exactly one chip, and the chips are installed at different times. Specifically, these times are represented by the array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the time (in minutes) at which a chip is installed in the $$$i$$$-th room. As soon as a chip is installed, it changes the room's light status every $$$k$$$ minutes — it turns on the light for $$$k$$$ minutes, then turns it off for the next $$$k$$$ minutes, then turns it back on for the next $$$k$$$ minutes, and so on. In other words, the light status is changed by the chip at minute $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_i + k$$$, $$$a_i + 2k$$$, $$$a_i + 3k$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th room. What is the earliest moment when all rooms in the apartment have their lights turned on?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rooms in the apartment and the period of the chips. The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the moments when the chips are installed. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the answer to the question (in minutes). If there is no such moment that the lights are turned on in all the rooms, print $$$-1$$$ instead.",
