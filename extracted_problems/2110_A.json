  "statement": "In 2077, everything became fashionable among robots, even arrays... We will call an array of integers $$$a$$$ fashionable if $$$\\min(a) + \\max(a)$$$ is divisible by $$$2$$$ without a remainder, where $$$\\min(a)$$$ — the value of the minimum element of the array $$$a$$$, and $$$\\max(a)$$$ — the value of the maximum element of the array $$$a$$$. You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. In one operation, you can remove any element from this array. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the array $$$a$$$ fashionable .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 50$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of operations required to make the array $$$a$$$ fashionable .",
