  "statement": "Little Misha goes to the programming club and solves nothing there. It may seem strange, but when you find out that Misha is filming a Minecraft series, everything will fall into place... Misha is inspired by Manhattan, so he built a city in Minecraft that can be imagined as a table of size $$$n \\times m$$$. $$$k$$$ students live in a city, the $$$i$$$-th student lives in the house, located at the intersection of the $$$x_i$$$-th row and the $$$y_i$$$-th column. Also, each student has a degree of his aggressiveness $$$w_i$$$. Since the city turned out to be very large, Misha decided to territorially limit the actions of his series to some square $$$s$$$, which sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. The length of the side of the square should be an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$\\min(n, m)$$$ cells. According to the plot, the main hero will come to the city and accidentally fall into the square $$$s$$$. Possessing a unique degree of aggressiveness $$$0$$$, he will be able to show his leadership qualities and assemble a team of calm, moderate and aggressive students. In order for the assembled team to be versatile and close-knit, degrees of aggressiveness of all students of the team must be pairwise distinct and must form a single segment of consecutive integers. Formally, if there exist students with degrees of aggressiveness $$$l, l+1, \\ldots, -1, 1, \\ldots, r-1, r$$$ inside the square $$$s$$$, where $$$l \\le 0 \\le r$$$, the main hero will be able to form a team of $$$r-l+1$$$ people (of course, he is included in this team). Notice , that it is not required to take all students from square $$$s$$$ to the team. Misha thinks that the team should consist of at least $$$t$$$ people. That is why he is interested, how many squares are there in the table in which the main hero will be able to form a team of at least $$$t$$$ people. Help him to calculate this.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 40\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\le n \\cdot m \\le 40\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le t \\le k + 1$$$) — the number of rows and columns in the table, and the number of students living in the city, respectively. Each of the following $$$k$$$ lines contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le y_i \\le m$$$, $$$1 \\le \\lvert w_i \\rvert \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of row and column, where the $$$i$$$-th student is living, and the degree of his aggressiveness.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer — the number of ways to choose the square $$$s$$$ in such way that the main hero will be able to form a team of at least $$$t$$$ people.",
