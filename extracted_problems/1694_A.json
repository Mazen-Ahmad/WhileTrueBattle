  "statement": "Define the score of some binary string $$$T$$$ as the absolute difference between the number of zeroes and ones in it. (for example, $$$T=$$$ 010001 contains $$$4$$$ zeroes and $$$2$$$ ones, so the score of $$$T$$$ is $$$|4-2| = 2$$$). Define the creepiness of some binary string $$$S$$$ as the maximum score among all of its prefixes (for example, the creepiness of $$$S=$$$ 01001 is equal to $$$2$$$ because the score of the prefix $$$S[1 \\ldots 4]$$$ is $$$2$$$ and the rest of the prefixes have a score of $$$2$$$ or less). Given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, construct a binary string consisting of $$$a$$$ zeroes and $$$b$$$ ones with the minimum possible creepiness.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1\\le t\\le 1000)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le a, b \\le 100$$$) — the numbers of zeroes and ones correspondingly.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a binary string consisting of $$$a$$$ zeroes and $$$b$$$ ones with the minimum possible creepiness. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
