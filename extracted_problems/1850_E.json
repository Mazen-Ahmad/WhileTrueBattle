  "statement": "Mircea has $$$n$$$ pictures. The $$$i$$$-th picture is a square with a side length of $$$s_i$$$ centimeters. He mounted each picture on a square piece of cardboard so that each picture has a border of $$$w$$$ centimeters of cardboard on all sides. In total, he used $$$c$$$ square centimeters of cardboard. Given the picture sizes and the value $$$c$$$, can you find the value of $$$w$$$? A picture of the first test case. Here $$$c = 50 = 5^2 + 4^2 + 3^2$$$, so $$$w=1$$$ is the answer. Please note that the piece of cardboard goes behind each picture, not just the border.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two positive integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\leq c \\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the number of paintings, and the amount of used square centimeters of cardboard. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s_i \\leq 10^4$$$) — the sizes of the paintings. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. Additional constraint on the input: Such an integer $$$w$$$ exists for each test case. Please note, that some of the input for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the value of $$$w$$$ ($$$w \\geq 1$$$) which was used to use exactly $$$c$$$ squared centimeters of cardboard.",
