  "statement": "The distance of a value $$$x$$$ in an array $$$c$$$, denoted as $$$d_x(c)$$$, is defined as the largest gap between any two occurrences of $$$x$$$ in $$$c$$$. Formally, $$$d_x(c) = \\max(j - i)$$$ over all pairs $$$i < j$$$ where $$$c_i = c_j = x$$$. If $$$x$$$ appears only once or not at all in $$$c$$$, then $$$d_x(c) = 0$$$. The beauty of an array is the sum of the distances of each distinct value in the array. Formally, the beauty of an array $$$c$$$ is equal to $$$\\sum\\limits_{1\\le x\\le n} d_x(c)$$$. Given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, an array $$$b$$$ is nice if it also has length $$$n$$$ and its elements satisfy $$$1\\le b_i\\le a_i$$$ for all $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$. Your task is to find the maximum possible beauty of any nice array.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le n$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer representing the maximum possible beauty among all nice arrays.",
