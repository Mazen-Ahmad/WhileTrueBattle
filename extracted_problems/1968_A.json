  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$x$$$. Your task is to find any integer $$$y$$$ $$$(1\\le y<x)$$$ such that $$$\\gcd(x,y)+y$$$ is maximum possible. Note that if there is more than one $$$y$$$ which satisfies the statement, you are allowed to find any. $$$\\gcd(a,b)$$$ is the Greatest Common Divisor of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. For example, $$$\\gcd(6,4)=2$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \\le x \\le 1000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output any $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le y < x$$$), which satisfies the statement.",
