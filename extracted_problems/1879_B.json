  "statement": "You are given a board of size $$$n \\times n$$$ ($$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ colums) and two arrays of positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Your task is to place the chips on this board so that the following condition is satisfied for every cell $$$(i, j)$$$: there exists at least one chip in the same column or in the same row as the cell $$$(i, j)$$$. I. e. there exists a cell $$$(x, y)$$$ such that there is a chip in that cell, and either $$$x = i$$$ or $$$y = j$$$ (or both). The cost of putting a chip in the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ is equal to $$$a_i + b_j$$$. For example, for $$$n=3$$$, $$$a=[1, 4, 1]$$$ and $$$b=[3, 2, 2]$$$. One of the possible chip placements is as follows: White squares are empty The total cost of that placement is $$$(1+3) + (1+2) + (1+2) = 10$$$. Calculate the minimum possible total cost of putting chips according to the rules above.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
