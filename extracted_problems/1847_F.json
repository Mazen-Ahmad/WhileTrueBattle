  "statement": "While tracking Diavolo's origins, Giorno receives a secret code from Polnareff. The code can be represented as an infinite sequence of positive integers: $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots $$$. Giorno immediately sees the pattern behind the code. The first $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ are given . For $$$i > n$$$ the value of $$$a_i$$$ is $$$(a_{i-n}\\ |\\ a_{i-n+1})$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operator . Pieces of information about Diavolo are hidden in $$$q$$$ questions. Each question has a positive integer $$$v$$$ associated with it and its answer is the smallest index $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i > v$$$. If no such $$$i$$$ exists, the answer is $$$-1$$$. Help Giorno in answering the questions!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ , $$$1 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the parts of the code which define the pattern. The $$$i$$$-th line of the next $$$q$$$ lines contain a single integer $$$v_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq v_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the question Giorno asks you. The sum of $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$q$$$ numbers. The $$$i$$$-th number is the answer to the $$$i$$$-th question asked by Giorno.",
