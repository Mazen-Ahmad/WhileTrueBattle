  "statement": "Cirno has a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$ edges. The graph has exactly one node that has no out edges. The $$$i$$$-th node has an integer $$$a_i$$$ on it. Every second the following happens: Let $$$S$$$ be the set of nodes $$$x$$$ that have $$$a_x > 0$$$. For all $$$x \\in S$$$, $$$1$$$ is subtracted from $$$a_x$$$, and then for each node $$$y$$$, such that there is an edge from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$, $$$1$$$ is added to $$$a_y$$$. Find the first moment of time when all $$$a_i$$$ become $$$0$$$. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the integer on vertices. Each line of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x, y$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$$$), represent a directed edge from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$. It is guaranteed that the graph is a DAG with no multi-edges, and there is exactly one node that has no out edges. It is guaranteed that both sum of $$$n$$$ and sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases are less than or equal to $$$10\\,000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print an integer in a separate line — the first moment of time when all $$$a_i$$$ become $$$0$$$, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
