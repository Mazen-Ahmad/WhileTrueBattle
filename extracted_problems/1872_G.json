  "statement": "Given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You need to perform the following operation exactly once: Choose $$$2$$$ integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) and replace the subarray $$$a[l \\ldots r]$$$ with the single element: the product of all elements in the subarray $$$(a_l \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot a_r)$$$. For example, if an operation with parameters $$$l = 2, r = 4$$$ is applied to the array $$$[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]$$$, the array will turn into $$$[5, 24, 1]$$$. Your task is to maximize the sum of the array after applying this operation. Find the optimal subarray to apply this operation.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$2$$$ integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) — the boundaries of the subarray to be replaced with the product. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.",
