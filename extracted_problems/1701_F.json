  "statement": "A triple of points $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$k$$$ on a coordinate line is called beautiful if $$$i < j < k$$$ and $$$k - i \\le d$$$. You are given a set of points on a coordinate line, initially empty. You have to process queries of three types: add a point; remove a point; calculate the number of beautiful triples consisting of points belonging to the set.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$q$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\le q, d \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries and the parameter for defining if a triple is beautiful, respectively. The second line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_q$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) denoting the queries. The integer $$$a_i$$$ denotes the $$$i$$$-th query in the following way: if the point $$$a_i$$$ belongs to the set, remove it; otherwise, add it; after adding or removing the point, print the number of beautiful triples.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print one integer — the number of beautiful triples after processing the respective query.",
