  "statement": "Kristina has two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, each containing $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. She can perform the following operation on array $$$a$$$ any number of times: apply a decrement to each non-zero element of the array, that is, replace the value of each element $$$a_i$$$ such that $$$a_i > 0$$$ with the value $$$a_i - 1$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$). If $$$a_i$$$ was $$$0$$$, its value does not change. Determine whether Kristina can get an array $$$b$$$ from an array $$$a$$$ in some number of operations (probably zero). In other words, can she make $$$a_i = b_i$$$ after some number of operations for each $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$? For example, let $$$n = 4$$$, $$$a = [3, 5, 4, 1]$$$ and $$$b = [1, 3, 2, 0]$$$. In this case, she can apply the operation twice: after the first application of the operation she gets $$$a = [2, 4, 3, 0]$$$; after the second use of the operation she gets $$$a = [1, 3, 2, 0]$$$. Thus, in two operations, she can get an array $$$b$$$ from an array $$$a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€”the number of test cases in the test. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$). The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). The third line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ values over all test cases in the test does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output on a separate line: YES , if by doing some number of operations it is possible to get an array $$$b$$$ from an array $$$a$$$; NO otherwise. You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).",
