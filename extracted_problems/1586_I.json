  "statement": "Omkar is creating a mosaic using colored square tiles, which he places in an $$$n \\times n$$$ grid. When the mosaic is complete, each cell in the grid will have either a glaucous or sinoper tile. However, currently he has only placed tiles in some cells. A completed mosaic will be a mastapeece if and only if each tile is adjacent to exactly $$$2$$$ tiles of the same color ($$$2$$$ tiles are adjacent if they share a side.) Omkar wants to fill the rest of the tiles so that the mosaic becomes a mastapeece . Now he is wondering, is the way to do this unique, and if it is, what is it?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2000$$$). Then follow $$$n$$$ lines with $$$n$$$ characters in each line. The $$$i$$$-th character in the $$$j$$$-th line corresponds to the cell in row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ of the grid, and will be $$$S$$$ if Omkar has placed a sinoper tile in this cell, $$$G$$$ if Omkar has placed a glaucous tile, $$$.$$$ if it's empty.",
  "outputFormat": "On the first line, print UNIQUE if there is a unique way to get a mastapeece, NONE if Omkar cannot create any, and MULTIPLE if there is more than one way to do so. All letters must be uppercase. If you print UNIQUE , then print $$$n$$$ additional lines with $$$n$$$ characters in each line, such that the $$$i$$$-th character in the $$$j^{\\text{th}}$$$ line is $$$S$$$ if the tile in row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ of the mastapeece is sinoper, and $$$G$$$ if it is glaucous.",
