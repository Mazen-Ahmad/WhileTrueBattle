  "statement": "The famous store \"Second Food\" sells groceries only two days a month. And the prices in each of days differ. You wanted to buy $$$n$$$ kilos of potatoes for a month. You know that on the first day of the month $$$1$$$ kilo of potatoes costs $$$a$$$ coins, and on the second day $$$b$$$ coins. In \"Second Food\" you can buy any integer kilograms of potatoes. Fortunately, \"Second Food\" has announced a promotion for potatoes, which is valid only on the first day of the month — for each $$$m$$$ kilos of potatoes you buy, you get $$$1$$$ kilo as a gift! In other words, you can get $$$m + 1$$$ kilograms by paying for $$$m$$$ kilograms. Find the minimum number of coins that you have to spend to buy at least $$$n$$$ kilos of potatoes.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ $$$(1 \\leq a, b \\leq 10^9)$$$ — the prices of $$$1$$$ kilo of potatoes on the first and second days, respectively. The second line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^9)$$$ — the required amount of potatoes to buy and the amount of potatoes to use the promotion.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print one integer — the minimum number of coins that you have to pay to buy at least $$$n$$$ kilos of potatoes.",
