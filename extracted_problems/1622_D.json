  "statement": "You are given a binary string (i. e. a string consisting of characters 0 and/or 1 ) $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation with the string $$$s$$$ at most once : choose a substring (a contiguous subsequence) of $$$s$$$ having exactly $$$k$$$ characters 1 in it, and shuffle it (reorder the characters in the substring as you wish). Calculate the number of different strings which can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by performing this operation at most once.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5000$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$). The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters 0 and/or 1 .",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer â€” the number of different strings which can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by performing the described operation at most once. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
