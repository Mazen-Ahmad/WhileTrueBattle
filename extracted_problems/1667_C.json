  "statement": "You are given a board with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The intersection of the $$$a$$$-th row and $$$b$$$-th column is denoted by $$$(a, b)$$$. A half-queen attacks cells in the same row, same column, and on one diagonal. More formally, a half-queen on $$$(a, b)$$$ attacks the cell $$$(c, d)$$$ if $$$a=c$$$ or $$$b=d$$$ or $$$a-b=c-d$$$. The blue cells are under attack. What is the minimum number of half-queens that can be placed on that board so as to ensure that each square is attacked by at least one half-queen? Construct an optimal solution.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the size of the board.",
  "outputFormat": "In the first line print a single integer $$$k$$$ — the minimum number of half-queens. In each of the next $$$k$$$ lines print two integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n$$$) — the position of the $$$i$$$-th half-queen. If there are multiple solutions, print any.",
