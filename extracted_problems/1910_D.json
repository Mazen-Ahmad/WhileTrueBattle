  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You goal is to make is strictly increasing. To achieve that, you perform each of the following operations exactly once: first, remove any element; second, select any number of elements (possibly, none or all $$$n-1$$$) and add $$$1$$$ to them. Note that you are not allowed to rearrange the elements of the array. For the resulting array $$$a'$$$, $$$a'_1 < a'_2 < \\dots < a'_{n-1}$$$ should hold. Determine if it's possible to achieve that.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements of the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print YES if it's possible to remove one element and add $$$1$$$ to some elements (possibly, none or all), so that the array becomes strictly increasing. Otherwise, print NO .",
