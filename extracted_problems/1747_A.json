  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You want to distribute these $$$n$$$ integers into two groups $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$ (groups can be empty) so that the following conditions are satisfied: For each $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$$$, $$$a_i$$$ goes into exactly one group. The value $$$|sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|$$$ is the maximum possible among all such ways to distribute the integers. Here $$$sum(s_1)$$$ denotes the sum of the numbers in the group $$$s_1$$$, and $$$sum(s_2)$$$ denotes the sum of the numbers in the group $$$s_2$$$. Determine the maximum possible value of $$$|sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$$$ — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2 \\ldots a_n$$$ $$$(-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9)$$$ — elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible value of $$$|sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|$$$.",
