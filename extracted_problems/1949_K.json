  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ and three positive integers $$$n_a, n_b, n_c$$$ satisfying $$$n_a+n_b+n_c = n$$$. You want to split the $$$n$$$ positive integers into three groups, so that: The first group contains $$$n_a$$$ numbers, the second group contains $$$n_b$$$ numbers, the third group contains $$$n_c$$$ numbers. Let $$$s_a$$$ be the sum of the numbers in the first group, $$$s_b$$$ be the sum in the second group, and $$$s_c$$$ be the sum in the third group. Then $$$s_a, s_b, s_c$$$ are the sides of a triangle with positive area. Determine if this is possible. If this is possible, find one way to do so.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 100\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains the integers $$$n, n_a, n_b, n_c$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 200\\,000, 1\\leq n_a,n_b,n_c \\leq n-2, n_a+n_b+n_c = n$$$) — the number of integers to split into three groups, and the desired sizes of the three groups. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq 10^{9}$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$200\\,000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if it is possible to split the numbers into three groups satisfying all the conditions. Otherwise, print $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$. If such a split exists, then describe the three groups as follows. On the next line, print $$$n_a$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n_a}$$$ — the numbers in the first group. On the next line, print $$$n_b$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{n_b}$$$ — the numbers in the second group. On the next line, print $$$n_c$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_{n_c}$$$ — the numbers in the third group. These $$$n_a+n_b+n_c=n$$$ integers should be a permutation of $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$, and they should satisfy the conditions from the statement. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
