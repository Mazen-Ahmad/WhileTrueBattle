  "statement": "You are given two arrays of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$. Let's define a transformation of the array $$$a$$$: Choose any non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$. Choose $$$k$$$ distinct array indices $$$1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k \\le n$$$. Add $$$1$$$ to each of $$$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\ldots, a_{i_k}$$$, all other elements of array $$$a$$$ remain unchanged. Permute the elements of array $$$a$$$ in any order. Is it possible to perform some transformation of the array $$$a$$$ exactly once , so that the resulting array is equal to $$$b$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the size of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-100 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$-100 \\le b_i \\le 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" YES \" (without quotes) if it is possible to perform a transformation of the array $$$a$$$, so that the resulting array is equal to $$$b$$$. Print \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).",
