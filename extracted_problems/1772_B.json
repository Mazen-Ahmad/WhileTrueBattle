  "statement": "You have a matrix $$$2 \\times 2$$$ filled with distinct integers. You want your matrix to become beautiful. The matrix is beautiful if the following two conditions are satisfied: in each row, the first element is smaller than the second element; in each column, the first element is smaller than the second element. You can perform the following operation on the matrix any number of times: rotate it clockwise by $$$90$$$ degrees, so the top left element shifts to the top right cell, the top right element shifts to the bottom right cell, and so on: Determine if it is possible to make the matrix beautiful by applying zero or more operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. Each of those lines contains two integers — the elements of the corresponding row of the matrix. In each matrix, all four elements are distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$100$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if the matrix can become beautiful, or NO otherwise. You may print each letter in any case ( YES , yes , Yes will all be recognized as positive answer, NO , no and nO will all be recognized as negative answer).",
