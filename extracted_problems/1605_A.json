  "statement": "A number $$$a_2$$$ is said to be the arithmetic mean of two numbers $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_3$$$, if the following condition holds: $$$a_1 + a_3 = 2\\cdot a_2$$$. We define an arithmetic mean deviation of three numbers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$ as follows: $$$d(a_1, a_2, a_3) = |a_1 + a_3 - 2 \\cdot a_2|$$$. Arithmetic means a lot to Jeevan. He has three numbers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$ and he wants to minimize the arithmetic mean deviation $$$d(a_1, a_2, a_3)$$$. To do so, he can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose $$$i, j$$$ from $$$\\{1, 2, 3\\}$$$ such that $$$i \\ne j$$$ and increment $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$ and decrement $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$ Help Jeevan find out the minimum value of $$$d(a_1, a_2, a_3)$$$ that can be obtained after applying the operation any number of times.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\le t \\le 5000)$$$ â€” the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$ $$$(1 \\le a_1, a_2, a_3 \\le 10^{8})$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum value of $$$d(a_1, a_2, a_3)$$$ that can be obtained after applying the operation any number of times.",
