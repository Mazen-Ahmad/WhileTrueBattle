  "statement": "One morning, Polycarp woke up and realized that $$$1543$$$ is the most favorite number in his life. The first thing that Polycarp saw that day as soon as he opened his eyes was a large wall carpet of size $$$n$$$ by $$$m$$$ cells; $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ are even integers. Each cell contains one of the digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$. Polycarp became curious about how many times the number $$$1543$$$ would appear in all layers$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of the carpet when traversed clockwise . $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The first layer of a carpet of size $$$n \\times m$$$ is defined as a closed strip of length $$$2 \\cdot (n+m-2)$$$ and thickness of $$$1$$$ element, surrounding its outer part. Each subsequent layer is defined as the first layer of the carpet obtained by removing all previous layers from the original carpet.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases. The first line of each test case contains a pair of numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^3$$$, $$$n, m$$$ — even integers). This is followed by $$$n$$$ lines of length $$$m$$$, consisting of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$ — the description of the carpet. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single number — the total number of times $$$1543$$$ appears in all layers of the carpet in the order of traversal clockwise .",
