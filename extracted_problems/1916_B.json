  "statement": "A certain number $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$ is chosen. You are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, which are the two largest divisors of the number $$$x$$$. At the same time, the condition $$$1 \\le a < b < x$$$ is satisfied. For the given numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, you need to find the value of $$$x$$$. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$ The number $$$y$$$ is a divisor of the number $$$x$$$ if there is an integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$x = y \\cdot k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The only line of each test cases contains two integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a < b \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ are the two largest divisors for some number $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the number $$$x$$$, such that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are the two largest divisors of the number $$$x$$$. If there are several answers, print any of them.",
