  "statement": "For an array $$$b$$$ of $$$m$$$ non-negative integers, define $$$f(b)$$$ as the maximum value of $$$\\max\\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \\min\\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)$$$ over all possible non-negative integers $$$x$$$, where $$$|$$$ is bitwise OR operation . You are given integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$. You start with an empty array $$$a$$$. Process the following $$$q$$$ queries: $$$v$$$: append $$$v$$$ to the back of $$$a$$$ and then output $$$f(a)$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$0 \\leq v < n$$$. The queries are given in a modified way.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2^{22}$$$, $$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of queries. The second line of each test case contains $$$q$$$ space-separated integers $$$e_1,e_2,\\ldots,e_q$$$ ($$$0 \\leq e_i < n$$$) — the encrypted values of $$$v$$$. Let $$$\\mathrm{last}_i$$$ equal the output of the $$$(i-1)$$$-th query for $$$i\\geq 2$$$ and $$$\\mathrm{last}_i=0$$$ for $$$i=1$$$. Then the value of $$$v$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th query is ($$$e_i + \\mathrm{last}_i$$$) modulo $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2^{22}$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$q$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer is the output of the $$$i$$$-th query.",
