  "statement": "There is an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ consisting of values $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, and $$$2$$$, and an integer $$$s$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ contains at least one $$$0$$$, one $$$1$$$, and one $$$2$$$. Alice wants to start from index $$$1$$$ and perform steps of length $$$1$$$ to the right or to the left, and reach index $$$n$$$ at the end. While Alice moves, she calculates the sum of the values she is visiting, and she wants the sum to be exactly $$$s$$$. Formally, Alice wants to find a sequence $$$[i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_m]$$$ of indices, such that: $$$i_1 = 1$$$, $$$i_m = n$$$. $$$1 \\leq i_j \\leq n$$$ for all $$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$. $$$|i_{j} - i_{j+1}| = 1$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq j < m$$$. $$$a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + \\ldots + a_{i_m} = s$$$. However, Bob wants to rearrange $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ to prevent Alice from achieving her target. Determine whether it is possible to rearrange $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ such that Alice cannot find her target sequence (even if Alice is smart enough). If it is possible, you also need to output the rearranged array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 50$$$, $$$0 \\le s \\le 1000$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 2$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$a$$$ contains at least one $$$0$$$, one $$$1$$$, and one $$$2$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is possible to rearrange $$$a$$$ such that Alice cannot find her target sequence, output $$$n$$$ integers â€” such rearrangement of $$$a$$$. Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$ instead.",
