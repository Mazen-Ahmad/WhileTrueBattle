  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ strings $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$, each consisting of lowercase and uppercase English letters. In addition, it's guaranteed that each character occurs in each string at most twice . Find the longest common subsequence of these strings. A string $$$t$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$s$$$ if $$$t$$$ can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) symbols.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 5$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10$$$) — the number of strings. Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains the corresponding string $$$s_i$$$. Each $$$s_i$$$ is non-empty, consists only of uppercase and lowercase English letters, and no character appears more than twice in each string.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print the answer in two lines: In the first line print the length of the longest common subsequence. In the second line print the longest common subsequence. If there are multiple such subsequences, print any of them.",
