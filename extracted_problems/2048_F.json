  "statement": "Kevin is a student from Eversleeping Town, currently attending a math class where the teacher is giving him division exercises. On the board, there are two rows of positive integers written, each containing $$$ n $$$ numbers. The first row is $$$ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $$$, and the second row is $$$ b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n $$$. For each division exercise, Kevin can choose any segment $$$ [l, r] $$$ and find the smallest value $$$ x $$$ among $$$ b_l, b_{l+1}, \\ldots, b_r $$$. He will then modify each $$$ a_i $$$ for $$$ l \\leq i \\leq r $$$ to be the ceiling of $$$ a_i $$$ divided by $$$ x $$$. Formally, he selects two integers $$$ 1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n $$$, sets $$$ x = \\min_{l \\leq i \\leq r} b_i $$$, and changes all $$$ a_i $$$ for $$$ l \\leq i \\leq r $$$ to $$$ \\lceil \\frac{a_i}{x} \\rceil $$$. Kevin can leave class and go home when all $$$ a_i $$$ become $$$ 1 $$$. He is eager to leave and wants to know the minimum number of division exercises required to achieve this.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$ t $$$ ($$$ 1 \\le t \\le 10^4 $$$). The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$ n $$$ ($$$ 1 \\le n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5 $$$) — the length of the sequence $$$ a $$$ and $$$ b $$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$ n $$$ integers $$$ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $$$ ($$$ 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{18} $$$) — the first row of integers on the board. The third line of each test case contains $$$ n $$$ integers $$$ b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n $$$ ($$$ 2 \\le b_i \\le 10^{18} $$$) — the second row of integers on the board. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$ n $$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$ 2 \\cdot 10^5 $$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of division exercises required to leave class.",
