  "statement": "Drink water. — Sun Tzu, The Art of Becoming a Healthy Programmer This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that $$$x=n$$$ in this version. You must solve both versions to be able to hack. You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$x=n$$$). There are $$$n$$$ balls lined up in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Initially, there is a value $$$a_i$$$ written on the $$$i$$$-th ball. For each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, we define a function $$$f(i)$$$ as follows: Suppose you have a set $$$S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, i\\}$$$. In each operation, you have to select an integer $$$l$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l < i$$$) from $$$S$$$ such that $$$l$$$ is not the largest element of $$$S$$$. Suppose $$$r$$$ is the smallest element in $$$S$$$ which is greater than $$$l$$$. If $$$a_l > a_r$$$, you set $$$a_l = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$. If $$$a_l < a_r$$$, you set $$$a_r = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$. If $$$a_l = a_r$$$, you choose either the integer $$$l$$$ or $$$r$$$ to remove from $$$S$$$: If you choose to remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$, you set $$$a_r = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$l$$$ from $$$S$$$. If you choose to remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$, you set $$$a_l = a_l + a_r$$$ and remove $$$r$$$ from $$$S$$$. $$$f(i)$$$ denotes the number of integers $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j \\le i$$$) such that it is possible to obtain $$$S = \\{j\\}$$$ after performing the above operations exactly $$$i - 1$$$ times. For each integer $$$i$$$ from $$$x$$$ to $$$n$$$, you need to find $$$f(i)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5; x = n$$$) — the number of balls and the smallest index $$$i$$$ for which you need to find $$$f(i)$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the initial number written on each ball. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n-x+1$$$ space separated integers on a new line, where the $$$j$$$-th integer should represent $$$f(x+j-1)$$$.",
