  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. Li Ming and Li Hua are playing a game. Li Hua has a chessboard of size $$$n\\times m$$$. Denote $$$(r, c)$$$ ($$$1\\le r\\le n, 1\\le c\\le m$$$) as the cell on the $$$r$$$-th row from the top and on the $$$c$$$-th column from the left. Li Ming put a king on the chessboard and Li Hua needs to guess its position. Li Hua can ask Li Ming no more than $$$3$$$ questions. In each question, he can choose a cell and ask the minimum steps needed to move the king to the chosen cell. Each question is independent, which means the king doesn't actually move. A king can move from $$$(x,y)$$$ to $$$(x',y')$$$ if and only if $$$\\max\\{|x-x'|,|y-y'|\\}=1$$$ (shown in the following picture). The position of the king is chosen before the interaction. Suppose you were Li Hua, please solve this problem.",
