  "statement": "Piggy gives Turtle three sequences $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$, and $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$$$. Turtle will choose a subsequence of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ of length $$$m$$$, let it be $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m$$$. The subsequence should satisfy the following conditions: $$$a_{p_1} \\le a_{p_2} \\le \\cdots \\le a_{p_m}$$$; All $$$b_{p_i}$$$ for all indices $$$i$$$ are pairwise distinct , i.e., there don't exist two different indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ such that $$$b_{p_i} = b_{p_j}$$$. Help him find the maximum value of $$$\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^m c_{p_i}$$$, or tell him that it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length $$$m$$$ that satisfies the conditions above. Recall that a sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3000$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 5$$$) — the lengths of the three sequences and the required length of the subsequence. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$a$$$. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$b$$$. The fourth line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le 10^4$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$c$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Output a single integer — the maximum value of $$$\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^m c_{p_i}$$$. If it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length $$$m$$$ that satisfies the conditions above, output $$$-1$$$.",
