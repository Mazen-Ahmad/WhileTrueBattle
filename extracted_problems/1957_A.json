  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ sticks of lengths $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Find the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously, such that: Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. No stick is used in more than $$$1$$$ polygon. Note: Sticks cannot be broken.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the number of sticks available. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$$$) — the stick lengths.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks available.",
