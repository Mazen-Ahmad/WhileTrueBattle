  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$k \\le 10^{12}$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. Given a $$$w \\times h$$$ rectangle on the $$$Oxy$$$ plane, with points $$$(0, 0)$$$ at the bottom-left and $$$(w, h)$$$ at the top-right of the rectangle. You also have a robot initially at point $$$(0, 0)$$$ and a script $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters. Each character is either L , R , U , or D , which tells the robot to move left, right, up, or down respectively. The robot can only move inside the rectangle; otherwise, it will change the script $$$s$$$ as follows: If it tries to move outside a vertical border, it changes all L characters to R 's (and vice versa, all R 's to L 's). If it tries to move outside a horizontal border, it changes all U characters to D 's (and vice versa, all D 's to U 's). Then, it will execute the changed script starting from the character which it couldn't execute. An example of the robot's movement process, $$$s = \\texttt{\"ULULURD\"}$$$ The script $$$s$$$ will be executed for $$$k$$$ times continuously. All changes to the string $$$s$$$ will be retained even when it is repeated. During this process, how many times will the robot move to the point $$$(0, 0)$$$ in total? Note that the initial position does NOT count .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$w$$$, and $$$h$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, w, h \\le 10^6$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^{12}$$$). The second line contains a single string $$$s$$$ of size $$$n$$$ ($$$s_i \\in \\{\\texttt{L}, \\texttt{R}, \\texttt{U}, \\texttt{D}\\}$$$) — the script to be executed. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the number of times the robot reaches $$$(0, 0)$$$ when executing script $$$s$$$ for $$$k$$$ times continuously.",
