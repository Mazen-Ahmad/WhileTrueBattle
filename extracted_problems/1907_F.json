  "statement": "Given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. You can make two types of operations with this array: Shift: move the last element of array to the first place, and shift all other elements to the right, so you get the array $$$a_n, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$$$. Reverse: reverse the whole array, so you get the array $$$a_n, a_{n-1}, \\ldots, a_1$$$. Your task is to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the minimal number of operations, or say that it is impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — size of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array. It is guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output the number $$$k$$$, the minimal number of operations you need to sort the array. If it is impossible to sort the array using these operations, output $$$-1$$$.",
