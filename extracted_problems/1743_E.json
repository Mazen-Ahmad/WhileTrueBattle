  "statement": "Monocarp is playing a video game. In the game, he controls a spaceship and has to destroy an enemy spaceship. Monocarp has two lasers installed on his spaceship. Both lasers $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ have two values: $$$p_i$$$ — the power of the laser; $$$t_i$$$ — the reload time of the laser. When a laser is fully charged, Monocarp can either shoot it or wait for the other laser to charge and shoot both of them at the same time. An enemy spaceship has $$$h$$$ durability and $$$s$$$ shield capacity. When Monocarp shoots an enemy spaceship, it receives $$$(P - s)$$$ damage (i. e. $$$(P - s)$$$ gets subtracted from its durability), where $$$P$$$ is the total power of the lasers that Monocarp shoots (i. e. $$$p_i$$$ if he only shoots laser $$$i$$$ and $$$p_1 + p_2$$$ if he shoots both lasers at the same time). An enemy spaceship is considered destroyed when its durability becomes $$$0$$$ or lower. Initially, both lasers are zero charged. What's the lowest amount of time it can take Monocarp to destroy an enemy spaceship?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$p_1$$$ and $$$t_1$$$ ($$$2 \\le p_1 \\le 5000$$$; $$$1 \\le t_1 \\le 10^{12}$$$) — the power and the reload time of the first laser. The second line contains two integers $$$p_2$$$ and $$$t_2$$$ ($$$2 \\le p_2 \\le 5000$$$; $$$1 \\le t_2 \\le 10^{12}$$$) — the power and the reload time of the second laser. The third line contains two integers $$$h$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le h \\le 5000$$$; $$$1 \\le s < \\min(p_1, p_2)$$$) — the durability and the shield capacity of an enemy spaceship. Note that the last constraint implies that Monocarp will always be able to destroy an enemy spaceship.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer — the lowest amount of time it can take Monocarp to destroy an enemy spaceship.",
