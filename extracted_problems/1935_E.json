  "statement": "The New Year has arrived in the Master's Assistance Center, which means it's time to introduce a new feature! Now students are given distance learning courses, with a total of $$$n$$$ courses available. For the $$$i$$$-th distance learning course, a student can receive a grade ranging from $$$x_i$$$ to $$$y_i$$$. However, not all courses may be available to each student. Specifically, the $$$j$$$-th student is only given courses with numbers from $$$l_j$$$ to $$$r_j$$$, meaning the distance learning courses with numbers $$$l_j, l_j + 1, \\ldots, r_j$$$. The creators of the distance learning courses have decided to determine the final grade in a special way. Let the $$$j$$$-th student receive grades $$$c_{l_j}, c_{l_j + 1}, \\ldots, c_{r_j}$$$ for their distance learning courses. Then their final grade will be equal to $$$c_{l_j}$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$c_{l_j + 1}$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$\\ldots$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$c_{r_j}$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation. Since the chatbot for solving distance learning courses is broken, the students have asked for your help. For each of the $$$q$$$ students, tell them the maximum final grade they can achieve.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of distance learning courses. Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le x_i \\le y_i < 2^{30}$$$) — the minimum and maximum grade that can be received for the $$$i$$$-th course. The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of students. Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_j$$$ and $$$r_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_j \\le r_j \\le n$$$) — the minimum and maximum course numbers accessible to the $$$j$$$-th student. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$q$$$ integers, where the $$$j$$$-th integer is the maximum final grade that the $$$j$$$-th student can achieve.",
