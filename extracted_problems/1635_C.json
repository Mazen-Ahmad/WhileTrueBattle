  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements. Your can perform the following operation no more than $$$n$$$ times: Select three indices $$$x,y,z$$$ $$$(1 \\leq x < y < z \\leq n)$$$ and replace $$$a_x$$$ with $$$a_y - a_z$$$. After the operation, $$$|a_x|$$$ need to be less than $$$10^{18}$$$. Your goal is to make the resulting array non-decreasing . If there are multiple solutions, you can output any. If it is impossible to achieve, you should report it as well.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line will contain a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 10000)$$$ — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(3 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5)$$$ — the size of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots ,a_n$$$ $$$(-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9)$$$, the elements of $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$-1$$$ in a single line if there is no solution. Otherwise in the first line you should print a single integer $$$m$$$ $$$(0 \\leq m \\leq n)$$$ — number of operations you performed. Then the $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines should contain three integers $$$x,y,z$$$ $$$(1 \\leq x < y < z \\leq n)$$$— description of the $$$i$$$-th operation. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations in this task.",
