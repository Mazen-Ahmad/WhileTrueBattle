  "statement": "You are given a rooted tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The root is vertex $$$1$$$. There is also a string $$$s$$$ denoting the color of each vertex: if $$$s_i = \\texttt{B}$$$, then vertex $$$i$$$ is black, and if $$$s_i = \\texttt{W}$$$, then vertex $$$i$$$ is white. A subtree of the tree is called balanced if the number of white vertices equals the number of black vertices. Count the number of balanced subtrees. A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree with a selected vertex, which is called the root . In this problem, all trees have root $$$1$$$. The tree is specified by an array of parents $$$a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ containing $$$n-1$$$ numbers: $$$a_i$$$ is the parent of the vertex with the number $$$i$$$ for all $$$i = 2, \\dots, n$$$. The parent of a vertex $$$u$$$ is a vertex that is the next vertex on a simple path from $$$u$$$ to the root. The subtree of a vertex $$$u$$$ is the set of all vertices that pass through $$$u$$$ on a simple path to the root. For example, in the picture below, $$$7$$$ is in the subtree of $$$3$$$ because the simple path $$$7 \\to 5 \\to 3 \\to 1$$$ passes through $$$3$$$. Note that a vertex is included in its subtree, and the subtree of the root is the entire tree. The picture shows the tree for $$$n=7$$$, $$$a=[1,1,2,3,3,5]$$$, and $$$s=\\texttt{WBBWWBW}$$$. The subtree at the vertex $$$3$$$ is balanced.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 4000$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree. The second line of each test case contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i < i$$$) — the parents of the vertices $$$2, \\dots, n$$$. The third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters $$$\\texttt{B}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{W}$$$ — the coloring of the tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of balanced subtrees.",
