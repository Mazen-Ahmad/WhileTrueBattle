  "statement": "Cirno_9baka has a paper tape with $$$n$$$ cells in a row on it. As he thinks that the blank paper tape is too dull, he wants to paint these cells with $$$m$$$ kinds of colors. For some aesthetic reasons, he thinks that the $$$i$$$-th color must be used exactly $$$a_i$$$ times, and for every $$$k$$$ consecutive cells, their colors have to be distinct. Help Cirno_9baka to figure out if there is such a way to paint the cells.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$m \\leq n$$$). Here $$$n$$$ denotes the number of cells, $$$m$$$ denotes the number of colors, and $$$k$$$ means that for every $$$k$$$ consecutive cells, their colors have to be distinct. The second line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\cdots , a_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the numbers of times that colors have to be used. It's guaranteed that $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_m = n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \"YES\" if there is at least one possible coloring scheme; otherwise, output \"NO\". You may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", and \"yEs\" will all be recognized as positive answers).",
