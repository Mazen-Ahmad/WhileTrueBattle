  "statement": "For $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k$$$, the value $$$\\gcd(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k)$$$ is the greatest common divisor of the integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k$$$ — the largest integer $$$z$$$ such that all the integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k$$$ are divisible by $$$z$$$. You are given three arrays $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ and $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, containing positive integers. You also have a machine that allows you to swap $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ for any $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$). Each swap costs you $$$c_i$$$ coins. Find the maximum possible value of $$$$$$\\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) + \\gcd(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n)$$$$$$ that you can get by paying in total at most $$$d$$$ coins for swapping some elements. The amount of coins you have changes a lot, so find the answer to this question for each of the $$$q$$$ possible values $$$d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_q$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "There are two integers on the first line — the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq q \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$). On the second line, there are $$$n$$$ integers — the numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^8$$$). On the third line, there are $$$n$$$ integers — the numbers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^8$$$). On the fourth line, there are $$$n$$$ integers — the numbers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq c_i \\leq 10^9$$$). On the fifth line, there are $$$q$$$ integers — the numbers $$$d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_q$$$ ($$$0 \\leq d_i \\leq 10^{15}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$q$$$ integers — the maximum value you can get for each of the $$$q$$$ possible values $$$d$$$.",
