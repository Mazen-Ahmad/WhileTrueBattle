  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$k$$$ and a string $$$s$$$ that consists only of characters 'a' (a lowercase Latin letter) and '*' (an asterisk). Each asterisk should be replaced with several (from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$ inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisk can be replaced with different counts of letter 'b'. The result of the replacement is called a BA-string . Two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are different if they either have different lengths or there exists such a position $$$i$$$ that $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$. A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\ne b$$$; in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$. Now consider all different BA-strings and find the $$$x$$$-th lexicographically smallest of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2000$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le 2000$$$; $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^{18}$$$). $$$n$$$ is the length of string $$$s$$$. The second line of each testcase is a string $$$s$$$. It consists of $$$n$$$ characters, each of them is either 'a' (a lowercase Latin letter) or '*' (an asterisk). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2000$$$. For each testcase $$$x$$$ doesn't exceed the total number of different BA-strings. String $$$s$$$ contains at least one character 'a'.",
