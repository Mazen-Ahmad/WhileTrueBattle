  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. Returning from a restful vacation on Australia's Gold Coast, Penchick forgot to bring home gifts for his pet duck Duong Canh! But perhaps a beautiful problem crafted through deep thought on the scenic beaches could be the perfect souvenir. There is a hidden permutation$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where $$$n$$$ is even. You are allowed to make the following query: Choose a subsequence$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ of the permutation $$$p$$$ with even length $$$4\\le k\\le n$$$. The interactor will return the value of the two medians$$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$ in the chosen subsequence. Find the index of the two medians in permutation $$$p$$$ using at most $$$80$$$ queries. Note that the interactor is non-adaptive . This means that the permutation $$$p$$$ is fixed at the beginning and will not change based on your queries. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions. $$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$The two medians of an array $$$a$$$ with even length $$$k$$$ are defined as the $$$\\frac{k}{2}$$$-th and $$$\\left(\\frac{k}{2} + 1\\right)$$$-th smallest element in the array ($$$1$$$-indexed).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$6 \\le n \\le 100$$$, $$$n$$$ is even) — the length of the hidden permutation $$$p$$$. For each test case, after reading the integer $$$n$$$, you should begin the interaction and find the answer before reading $$$n$$$ for the next test case. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.",
