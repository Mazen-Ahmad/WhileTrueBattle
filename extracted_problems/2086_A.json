  "statement": "The most valuable berry of the Karelian forests is cloudberry. To make jam from cloudberries, you take equal amounts of berries and sugar and cook them. Thus, if you have $$$2$$$ kg of berries, you need $$$2$$$ kg of sugar. However, from $$$2$$$ kg of berries and $$$2$$$ kg of sugar, you will not get $$$4$$$ kg of jam, as one might expect, but only $$$3$$$ kg, since some of the jam evaporates during cooking. Specifically, during standard cooking, exactly a quarter (or $$$25\\%$$$) of the jam evaporates. How many kilograms of cloudberries are needed to prepare $$$n$$$ $$$3$$$-kilogram jars of jam?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases. Each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^8$$$) — the number of jars of jam that need to be prepared.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the amount of berries needed for the jam in kilograms.",
