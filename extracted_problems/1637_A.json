  "statement": "You have an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can exactly once select an integer $$$len$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n - 1$$$ inclusively, and then sort in non-decreasing order the prefix of the array of length $$$len$$$ and the suffix of the array of length $$$n - len$$$ independently. For example, if the array is $$$a = [3, 1, 4, 5, 2]$$$, and you choose $$$len = 2$$$, then after that the array will be equal to $$$[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]$$$. Could it be that after performing this operation, the array will not be sorted in non-decreasing order?",
  "inputFormat": "There are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^4$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of the test case contains a sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the array elements. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case of input data, output \" YES \" (without quotes), if the array may be not sorted in non-decreasing order, output \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output each letter in any case (uppercase or lowercase).",
