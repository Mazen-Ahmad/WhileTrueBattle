  "statement": "It turns out that the meaning of life is a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ of the integers $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$). Omkar, having created all life, knows this permutation, and will allow you to figure it out using some queries. A query consists of an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$. $$$a$$$ is not required to be a permutation. Omkar will first compute the pairwise sum of $$$a$$$ and $$$p$$$, meaning that he will compute an array $$$s$$$ where $$$s_j = p_j + a_j$$$ for all $$$j = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Then, he will find the smallest index $$$k$$$ such that $$$s_k$$$ occurs more than once in $$$s$$$, and answer with $$$k$$$. If there is no such index $$$k$$$, then he will answer with $$$0$$$. You can perform at most $$$2n$$$ queries. Figure out the meaning of life $$$p$$$.",
