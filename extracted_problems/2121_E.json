  "statement": "For two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, we define $$$f(a, b)$$$ as the number of positions in the decimal representation of the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ where their digits are the same. For example, $$$f(12, 21) = 0$$$, $$$f(31, 37) = 1$$$, $$$f(19891, 18981) = 2$$$, $$$f(54321, 24361) = 3$$$. You are given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ of the same length in decimal representation. Consider all integers $$$l \\leq x \\leq r$$$. Your task is to find the minimum value of $$$f(l, x) + f(x, r)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r < 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ have the same length in decimal representation and do not have leading zeros.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum value of $$$f(l, x) + f(x, r)$$$ among all integer values $$$l \\leq x \\leq r$$$.",
