  "statement": "Monocarp is playing a game \"Assimilation IV\". In this game he manages a great empire: builds cities and conquers new lands. Monocarp's empire has $$$n$$$ cities. In order to conquer new lands he plans to build one Monument in each city . The game is turn-based and, since Monocarp is still amateur, he builds exactly one Monument per turn. Monocarp has $$$m$$$ points on the map he'd like to control using the constructed Monuments. For each point he knows the distance between it and each city. Monuments work in the following way: when built in some city, a Monument controls all points at distance at most $$$1$$$ to this city. Next turn, the Monument controls all points at distance at most $$$2$$$, the turn after — at distance at most $$$3$$$, and so on. Monocarp will build $$$n$$$ Monuments in $$$n$$$ turns and his empire will conquer all points that are controlled by at least one Monument. Monocarp can't figure out any strategy, so during each turn he will choose a city for a Monument randomly among all remaining cities (cities without Monuments). Monocarp wants to know how many points (among $$$m$$$ of them) he will conquer at the end of turn number $$$n$$$. Help him to calculate the expected number of conquered points!",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 20$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of cities and the number of points. Next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers each: the $$$j$$$-th integer of the $$$i$$$-th line $$$d_{i, j}$$$ ($$$1 \\le d_{i, j} \\le n + 1$$$) is the distance between the $$$i$$$-th city and the $$$j$$$-th point.",
  "outputFormat": "It can be shown that the expected number of points Monocarp conquers at the end of the $$$n$$$-th turn can be represented as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. Print this fraction modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$, i. e. value $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$ where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is such number that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.",
