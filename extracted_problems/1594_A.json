  "statement": "Theofanis has a riddle for you and if you manage to solve it, he will give you a Cypriot snack halloumi for free (Cypriot cheese). You are given an integer $$$n$$$. You need to find two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$-10^{18} \\le l < r \\le 10^{18}$$$ and $$$l + (l + 1) + \\ldots + (r - 1) + r = n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$-10^{18} \\le l < r \\le 10^{18}$$$ and $$$l + (l + 1) + \\ldots + (r - 1) + r = n$$$. It can be proven that an answer always exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.",
