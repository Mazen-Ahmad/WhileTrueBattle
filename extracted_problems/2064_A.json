  "statement": "One day after waking up, your friend challenged you to a brogramming contest. In a brogramming contest, you are given a binary string$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an initially empty binary string $$$t$$$. During a brogramming contest, you can make either of the following moves any number of times: remove some suffix$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ from $$$s$$$ and place it at the end of $$$t$$$, or remove some suffix from $$$t$$$ and place it at the end of $$$s$$$. To win the brogramming contest, you must make the minimum number of moves required to make $$$s$$$ contain only the character $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$t$$$ contain only the character $$$\\texttt{1}$$$. Find the minimum number of moves required. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A binary string is a string consisting of characters $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A string $$$a$$$ is a suffix of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning of $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case is an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains the binary string $$$s$$$. The sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, output the minimum number of moves required.",
