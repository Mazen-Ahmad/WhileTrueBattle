  "statement": "You are given an integer array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Does there exist an array $$$b$$$ consisting of $$$n+1$$$ positive integers such that $$$a_i=\\gcd (b_i,b_{i+1})$$$ for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$)? Note that $$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ representing the array $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^4$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" YES \" if such $$$b$$$ exists, otherwise output \" NO \". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).",
