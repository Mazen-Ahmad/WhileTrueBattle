  "statement": "Ntarsis has been given a set $$$S$$$, initially containing integers $$$1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10^{1000}$$$ in sorted order. Every day, he will remove the $$$a_1$$$-th, $$$a_2$$$-th, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$-th smallest numbers in $$$S$$$ simultaneously . What is the smallest element in $$$S$$$ after $$$k$$$ days?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case consists of two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,k \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$ and the number of days. The following line of each test case consists of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that: The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases won't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; The sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases won't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots < a_n$$$ for all test cases.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print an integer that is the smallest element in $$$S$$$ after $$$k$$$ days.",
