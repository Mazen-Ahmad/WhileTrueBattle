  "statement": "Given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, you need to handle a total of $$$q$$$ updates and queries of two types: $$$1$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ — for each index $$$i$$$ with $$$l \\leq i \\leq r$$$, update the value of $$$a_i$$$ to the sum of the digits of $$$a_i$$$. $$$2$$$ $$$x$$$ — output $$$a_x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array and the number of queries, respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). The next $$$q$$$ lines of each test case are of two forms: $$$1$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$) — it means, for each index $$$i$$$ with $$$l \\leq i \\leq r$$$, you should update the value of $$$a_i$$$ to the sum of its digits. $$$2$$$ $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq n$$$) — it means you should output $$$a_x$$$. There is at least one query of the second type. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. The sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the answers of queries of the second type, in the order they are given.",
