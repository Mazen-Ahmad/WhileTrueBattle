  "statement": "The pink soldiers drew $$$n$$$ circles with their center on the $$$x$$$-axis of the plane. Also, they have told that the sum of radii is exactly $$$m$$$ $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. Please find the number of integer points inside or on the border of at least one circle. Formally, the problem is defined as follows. You are given an integer sequence $$$x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$$$ and a positive integer sequence $$$r_1,r_2,\\ldots,r_n$$$, where it is known that $$$\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i = m$$$. You must count the number of integer pairs $$$(x,y)$$$ that satisfy the following condition. There exists an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$(x-x_i)^2 + y^2 \\le r_i^2$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$). $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$Is this information really useful? Don't ask me; I don't really know.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le m \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$$$ — the centers of the circles ($$$-10^9 \\le x_i \\le 10^9$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$r_1,r_2,\\ldots,r_n$$$ — the radii of the circles ($$$1 \\le r_i$$$, $$$\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i = m$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the number of integer points satisfying the condition on a separate line.",
