  "statement": "Saturnita's mood depends on an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, which only he knows the meaning of, and a function $$$f(k, a, l, r)$$$, which only he knows how to compute. Shown below is the pseudocode for his function $$$f(k, a, l, r)$$$. function f(k, a, l, r): ans := 0 for i from l to r (inclusive): while k is divisible by a[i]: k := k/a[i] ans := ans + k return ans You are given $$$q$$$ queries, each containing integers $$$k$$$, $$$l$$$, and $$$r$$$. For each query, please output $$$f(k,a,l,r)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5, 1 \\leq q \\leq 5\\cdot 10^4$$$). The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5$$$). The following $$$q$$$ lines each contain three integers $$$k$$$, $$$l$$$, and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^5, 1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$ over all test cases, and the sum of $$$q$$$ does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^4$$$ over all test cases.",
