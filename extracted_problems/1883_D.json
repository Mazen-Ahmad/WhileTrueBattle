  "statement": "Initially, you have an empty multiset of segments. You need to process $$$q$$$ operations of two types: $$$+$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ — Add the segment $$$(l, r)$$$ to the multiset, $$$-$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ — Remove exactly one segment $$$(l, r)$$$ from the multiset. It is guaranteed that this segment exists in the multiset. After each operation, you need to determine if there exists a pair of segments in the multiset that do not intersect. A pair of segments $$$(l, r)$$$ and $$$(a, b)$$$ do not intersect if there does not exist a point $$$x$$$ such that $$$l \\leq x \\leq r$$$ and $$$a \\leq x \\leq b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of operations. The next $$$q$$$ lines describe two types of operations. If it is an addition operation, it is given in the format $$$+$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$. If it is a deletion operation, it is given in the format $$$-$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "After each operation, print \" YES \" if there exists a pair of segments in the multiset that do not intersect, and \" NO \" otherwise. You can print the answer in any case (uppercase or lowercase). For example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \", and \" YES \" will be recognized as positive answers.",
