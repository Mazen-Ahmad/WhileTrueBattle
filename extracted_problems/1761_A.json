  "statement": "You are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$b$$$. Determine if there exist two permutations $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ of length $$$n$$$, for which the following conditions hold: The length of the longest common prefix of $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ is $$$a$$$. The length of the longest common suffix of $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ is $$$b$$$. A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array containing each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$1\\leq a,b\\leq n\\leq 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if such a pair of permutations exists, output \" Yes \"; otherwise, output \" No \". You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).",
