  "statement": "It is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$k = 3$$$. You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Find $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$$$, such that: $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_k = n$$$ $$$LCM(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k) \\le \\frac{n}{2}$$$ Here $$$LCM$$$ is the least common multiple of numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$$$. We can show that for given constraints the answer always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\le t \\le 10^4)$$$ â€” the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$, $$$k = 3$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$$$, for which all conditions are satisfied.",
