  "statement": "The Arms Factory needs a poster design pattern and finds Kevin for help. A poster design pattern is a bipartite graph with $$$ 2n $$$ vertices in the left part and $$$ m $$$ vertices in the right part, where there is an edge between each vertex in the left part and each vertex in the right part, resulting in a total of $$$ 2nm $$$ edges. Kevin must color each edge with a positive integer in the range $$$ [1, n] $$$. A poster design pattern is good if there are no monochromatic cycles$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ in the bipartite graph. Kevin needs your assistance in constructing a good bipartite graph or informing him if it is impossible. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A monochromatic cycle refers to a simple cycle in which all the edges are colored with the same color.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$ t $$$ ($$$ 1 \\le t \\le 100 $$$). The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$ n $$$ and $$$ m $$$ ($$$ 1 \\le n, m \\leq 10^3 $$$) — the bipartite graph has $$$ 2n $$$ vertices in the left part and $$$ m $$$ vertices in the right part. It is guaranteed that both the sum of $$$ n $$$ and the sum of $$$ m $$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$ 10^3 $$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no solution, then output No . Otherwise, output Yes , and then output $$$ 2n $$$ lines, with each line containing $$$ m $$$ positive integers. The $$$ i $$$-th line's $$$ j $$$-th integer represents the color of the edge between the $$$ i $$$-th vertex in the left part and the $$$ j $$$-th vertex in the right part. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them. You can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings yEs , yes , Yes , and YES will be recognized as a positive answer).",
