  "statement": "Stanley lives in a country that consists of $$$n$$$ cities (he lives in city $$$1$$$). There are bidirectional roads between some of the cities, and you know how long it takes to ride through each of them. Additionally, there is a flight between each pair of cities, the flight between cities $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ takes $$$(u - v)^2$$$ time. Stanley is quite afraid of flying because of watching \"Sully: Miracle on the Hudson\" recently, so he can take at most $$$k$$$ flights. Stanley wants to know the minimum time of a journey to each of the $$$n$$$ cities from the city $$$1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "In the first line of input there are three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^{5}$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^{5}$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 20$$$) — the number of cities, the number of roads, and the maximal number of flights Stanley can take. The following $$$m$$$ lines describe the roads. Each contains three integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$, $$$1 \\leq w \\leq 10^{9}$$$) — the cities the road connects and the time it takes to ride through. Note that some pairs of cities may be connected by more than one road.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$n$$$ integers, $$$i$$$-th of which is equal to the minimum time of traveling to city $$$i$$$.",
