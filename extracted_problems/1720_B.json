  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ that contains $$$n$$$ integers. You can choose any proper subsegment $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ of this array, meaning you can choose any two integers $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, where $$$r - l + 1 < n$$$. We define the beauty of a given subsegment as the value of the following expression: $$$$$$\\max(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{l-1}, a_{r+1}, a_{r+2}, \\ldots, a_{n}) - \\min(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{l-1}, a_{r+1}, a_{r+2}, \\ldots, a_{n}) + \\max(a_{l}, \\ldots, a_{r}) - \\min(a_{l}, \\ldots, a_{r}).$$$$$$ Please find the maximum beauty among all proper subsegments.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of each test case. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(4 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$$$ — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_{i} \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the given array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
