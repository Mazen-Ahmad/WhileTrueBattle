  "statement": "The symbol $$$\\wedge$$$ is quite ambiguous, especially when used without context. Sometimes it is used to denote a power ($$$a\\wedge b = a^b$$$) and sometimes it is used to denote the XOR operation ($$$a\\wedge b=a\\oplus b$$$). You have an ambiguous expression $$$E=A_1\\wedge A_2\\wedge A_3\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge A_n$$$. You can replace each $$$\\wedge$$$ symbol with either a $$$\\texttt{Power}$$$ operation or a $$$\\texttt{XOR}$$$ operation to get an unambiguous expression $$$E'$$$. The value of this expression $$$E'$$$ is determined according to the following rules: All $$$\\texttt{Power}$$$ operations are performed before any $$$\\texttt{XOR}$$$ operation. In other words, the $$$\\texttt{Power}$$$ operation takes precedence over $$$\\texttt{XOR}$$$ operation. For example, $$$4\\;\\texttt{XOR}\\;6\\;\\texttt{Power}\\;2=4\\oplus (6^2)=4\\oplus 36=32$$$. Consecutive powers are calculated from left to right . For example, $$$2\\;\\texttt{Power}\\;3 \\;\\texttt{Power}\\;4 = (2^3)^4 = 8^4 = 4096$$$. You are given an array $$$B$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$. The array $$$A$$$ is given by $$$A_i=2^{B_i}$$$ and the expression $$$E$$$ is given by $$$E=A_1\\wedge A_2\\wedge A_3\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge A_n$$$. You need to find the XOR of the values of all possible unambiguous expressions $$$E'$$$ which can be obtained from $$$E$$$ and has at least $$$k$$$ $$$\\wedge$$$ symbols used as $$$\\texttt{XOR}$$$ operation. Since the answer can be very large, you need to find it modulo $$$2^{2^{20}}$$$. Since this number can also be very large, you need to print its binary representation without leading zeroes . If the answer is equal to $$$0$$$, print $$$0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(1\\leq n\\leq 2^{20}, 0\\leq k < n)$$$. The second line of input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$B_1,B_2,\\ldots,B_n$$$ $$$(1\\leq B_i < 2^{20})$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single line containing a binary string without leading zeroes denoting the answer to the problem. If the answer is equal to $$$0$$$, print $$$0$$$.",
