  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$, consisting of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$. In one operation, you can pick any digit in this string, except for $$$0$$$ or the leftmost digit, decrease it by $$$1$$$, and then swap it with the digit left to the picked. For example, in one operation from the string $$$1023$$$, you can get $$$1103$$$ or $$$1022$$$. Find the lexicographically maximum string you can obtain after any number of operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input consists of an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line consisting of a digital string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$|s|$$$ denotes the length of $$$s$$$. The string does not contain leading zeroes. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ of all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer on a separate line.",
