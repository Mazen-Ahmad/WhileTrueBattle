  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ circles on a two-dimensional plane. The $$$i$$$-th circle is centered at $$$(x_i,y_i)$$$. Initially, all circles have a radius of $$$0$$$. The circles' radii increase at a rate of $$$1$$$ unit per second. You are currently at $$$(x_s,y_s)$$$; your goal is to reach $$$(x_t,y_t)$$$ without touching the circumference of any circle ( including the moment you reach $$$(x_t,y_t)$$$ ). You can move in any direction you want. However, your speed is limited to $$$1$$$ unit per second. Please determine whether this is possible.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le10^5$$$) — the number of circles. The next $$$n$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1\\le x_i,y_i\\le10^9$$$) — the center of each circle. The final line contains four integers $$$x_s$$$, $$$y_s$$$, $$$x_t$$$, $$$y_t$$$ ($$$1\\le x_s,y_s,x_t,y_t\\le10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the starting point and the goal, respectively. It is guaranteed that these $$$n+2$$$ points are distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if it is possible to reach the goal without touching the circle boundaries, and output $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise. You can output $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{No}$$$ in any case (for example, strings $$$\\texttt{yEs}$$$, $$$\\texttt{yes}$$$, $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ will be recognized as a positive response).",
