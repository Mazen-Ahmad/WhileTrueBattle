  "statement": "You are given a permutation $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. You can perform the following operation at most $$$n$$$ times: Choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, $$$i \\ne j$$$), swap $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_j$$$, swap $$$b_i$$$ with $$$b_j$$$. Determine whether $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ can be reverses of each other after operations. In other words, for each $$$i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$, $$$a_i = b_{n + 1 - i}$$$. If it is possible, output any valid sequence of operations. Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutations. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are permutations of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is impossible, output $$$-1$$$ in the only line. Otherwise, output a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\le m \\le n$$$) — the number of operations in the first line. In the following $$$m$$$ lines, output two integers — the indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, $$$i \\ne j$$$) in each operation in order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
