  "statement": "Little B and his friend Little K found a treasure map, and now they just need to dig up the treasure, which is buried at a depth of $$$a.5$$$ meters. They take turns digging. On the first day, Little B digs; on the second day, Little K. After each day, they switch. Little B digs exactly $$$x$$$ meters of soil each day, while Little K digs $$$y$$$ meters. They became curious about who will dig up the treasure first, meaning during whose day the total dug depth will exceed $$$a.5$$$. But they are too busy digging, so help them and tell who will dig up the treasure!",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. In a single line of each test case, three integers $$$x, y, a$$$ are given ($$$1 \\leq x, y, a \\leq 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \"NO\" if Little B digs it up first; otherwise, output \"YES\". You can output the answer in any case.",
