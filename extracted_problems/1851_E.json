  "statement": "Alchemist Nastya loves mixing potions. There are a total of $$$n$$$ types of potions, and one potion of type $$$i$$$ can be bought for $$$c_i$$$ coins. Any kind of potions can be obtained in no more than one way, by mixing from several others. The potions used in the mixing process will be consumed . Moreover, no potion can be obtained from itself through one or more mixing processes. As an experienced alchemist, Nastya has an unlimited supply of $$$k$$$ types of potions $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$$$, but she doesn't know which one she wants to obtain next. To decide, she asks you to find, for each $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, the minimum number of coins she needs to spend to obtain a potion of type $$$i$$$ next.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of each test contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows: The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k < n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the total number of potion types and the number of potion types Nastya already has. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the costs of buying the potions. The third line contains $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) — the indices of potions Nastya already has an unlimited supply of. This is followed by $$$n$$$ lines describing ways to obtain potions by mixing. Each line starts with the integer $$$m_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le m_i < n$$$) — the number of potions required to mix a potion of the type $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$). Then line contains $$$m_i$$$ distinct integers $$$e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_{m_i}$$$ ($$$1 \\le e_j \\le n$$$, $$$e_j \\ne i$$$) — the indices of potions needed to mix a potion of the type $$$i$$$. If this list is empty, then a potion of the type $$$i$$$ can only be bought. It is guaranteed that no potion can be obtained from itself through one or more mixing processes. It is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ values across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$m_i$$$ values across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers — the minimum number of coins Nastya needs to spend to obtain a potion of each type.",
