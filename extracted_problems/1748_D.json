  "statement": "You are given three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$d$$$. Your task is to find any integer $$$x$$$ which satisfies all of the following conditions, or determine that no such integers exist: $$$0 \\le x \\lt 2^{60}$$$; $$$a|x$$$ is divisible by $$$d$$$; $$$b|x$$$ is divisible by $$$d$$$. Here, $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line, containing three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\le a,b,d \\lt 2^{30}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print one integer. If there exists an integer $$$x$$$ which satisfies all of the conditions from the statement, print $$$x$$$. Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.",
