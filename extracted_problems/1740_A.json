  "statement": "Pak Chanek has a prime number$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$n$$$. Find a prime number $$$m$$$ such that $$$n + m$$$ is not prime. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A prime number is a number with exactly $$$2$$$ factors. The first few prime numbers are $$$2,3,5,7,11,13,\\ldots$$$. In particular, $$$1$$$ is not a prime number.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case. The only line of each test case contains a prime number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a line containing a prime number $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq m \\leq 10^5$$$) such that $$$n + m$$$ is not prime. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, such $$$m$$$ always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.",
