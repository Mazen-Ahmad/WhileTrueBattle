  "statement": "Madoka wants to enter to \" Novosibirsk State University \", but in the entrance exam she came across a very difficult task: Given an integer $$$n$$$, it is required to calculate $$$\\sum{\\operatorname{lcm}(c, \\gcd(a, b))}$$$, for all triples of positive integers $$$(a, b, c)$$$, where $$$a + b + c = n$$$. In this problem $$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, and $$$\\operatorname{lcm}(x, y)$$$ denotes the least common multiple of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Solve this problem for Madoka and help her to enter to the best university!",
  "inputFormat": "The first and the only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print exactly one interger â€” $$$\\sum{\\operatorname{lcm}(c, \\gcd(a, b))}$$$. Since the answer can be very large, then output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
