  "statement": "You have a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices, some of which are marked. A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. Let $$$f_i$$$ denote the maximum distance from vertex $$$i$$$ to any of the marked vertices. Your task is to find the minimum value of $$$f_i$$$ among all vertices. For example, in the tree shown in the example, vertices $$$2$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$7$$$ are marked. Then the array $$$f(i) = [2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3]$$$. The minimum $$$f_i$$$ is for vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of marked vertices, respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n, a_{i-1} < a_i$$$) — the indices of the marked vertices. The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ — the indices of vertices connected by the $$$i$$$-th edge. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum value of $$$f_i$$$ among all vertices.",
