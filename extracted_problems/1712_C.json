  "statement": "An array is sorted if it has no inversions A Young Boy You are given an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$. In one operation you do the following: Choose any integer $$$x$$$. For all $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i = x$$$, do $$$a_i := 0$$$ (assign $$$0$$$ to $$$a_i$$$). Find the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print one integer â€” the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.",
