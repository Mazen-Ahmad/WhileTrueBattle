  "statement": "There's a chessboard of size $$$n \\times n$$$. $$$m$$$ rooks are placed on it in such a way that: no two rooks occupy the same cell; no two rooks attack each other. A rook attacks all cells that are in its row or column. Is it possible to move exactly one rook (you can choose which one to move) into a different cell so that no two rooks still attack each other? A rook can move into any cell in its row or column if no other rook stands on its path.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 8$$$) — the size of the chessboard and the number of the rooks. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$) — the position of the $$$i$$$-th rook: $$$x_i$$$ is the row and $$$y_i$$$ is the column. No two rooks occupy the same cell. No two rooks attack each other.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print \" YES \" if it's possible to move exactly one rook into a different cell so that no two rooks still attack each other. Otherwise, print \" NO \".",
