  "statement": "You are given an integer array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation: choose an element of the array and replace it with any of its neighbor's value. For example, if $$$a=[3, 1, 2]$$$, you can get one of the arrays $$$[3, 3, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 2, 2]$$$ and $$$[1, 1, 2]$$$ using one operation, but not $$$[2, 1, 2$$$] or $$$[3, 4, 2]$$$. Your task is to calculate the minimum possible total sum of the array if you can perform the aforementioned operation at most $$$k$$$ times.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le 10$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible total sum of the array if you can perform the aforementioned operation at most $$$k$$$ times.",
