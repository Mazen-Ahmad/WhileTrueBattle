  "statement": "Monocarp plays a fantasy RPG. His character is a mage, so he casts spells. There are two types of spells he knows — basic spells and composite spells. There are $$$n$$$ basic spells in Monocarp's spell book, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each basic spell simply changes the health of the target: either decreases it or increases it. The $$$i$$$-th basic spell changes the target's health value by $$$b_i$$$ (increases by $$$b_i$$$ if $$$b_i$$$ is non-negative, or decreases by $$$|b_i|$$$ if $$$b_i$$$ is negative). If the target's health value goes to $$$0$$$ or below, it dies, and all next spells cast at it do nothing. There are also $$$m$$$ composite spells in the spell book, numbered from $$$n+1$$$ to $$$n+m$$$. Each composite spell is a sequence of other spells, cast in specific order. A composite spell can consist both of basic spells and composite spells; the $$$i$$$-th spell consists of $$$s_i$$$ other spells, and each of those spells has index strictly less than $$$i$$$ (so there is no situation that composite spells infinitely cast each other). So, actually, each composite spell can be considered a finite sequence of basic spells, although its length might be huge. Note that the same spell can appear in a composite spell multiple times. Monocarp has decided to cast the $$$(n+m)$$$-th spell from his spell book. The target of this spell is a monster with an initial health value of $$$hp$$$. Monocarp wants to know whether the monster will be killed or not, and if it will be killed, which basic spell will kill it.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case is given as follows: the first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$hp$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5000$$$; $$$1 \\le hp \\le 10^{9}$$$) — the number of basic spells and the initial health value of the monster; the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the descriptions of basic spells; the third line contains one integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 5000$$$) — the number of composite spells; then $$$m$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of these lines describes the $$$(n+i)$$$-th spell: it begins with an integer $$$s_{n+i}$$$ ($$$1 \\le s_{n+i} \\le 5000$$$) denoting the length of the spell (the number of spells it consists of); then a sequence of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$(n+i-1)$$$ follows, denoting the sequence of spells. Additional constraints on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$; the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$; the total length of all composite spells over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer: if the monster dies, print the index of the basic spell that kills the monster; otherwise, print $$$-1$$$.",
