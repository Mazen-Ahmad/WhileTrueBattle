  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements. You can apply the following operation to it any number of times: Select some subarray from $$$a$$$ of even size $$$2k$$$ that begins at position $$$l$$$ ($$$1\\le l \\le l+2\\cdot{k}-1\\le n$$$, $$$k \\ge 1$$$) and for each $$$i$$$ between $$$0$$$ and $$$k-1$$$ (inclusive), assign the value $$$a_{l+k+i}$$$ to $$$a_{l+i}$$$. For example, if $$$a = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 3]$$$, then choose $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$k = 2$$$, applying this operation the array will become $$$a = [3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 3]$$$. Find the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make all the elements of the array equal.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case consists of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$t$$$ lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case — the minimum number of operations needed to make equal all the elements of the array with the given operation.",
