  "statement": "Recently, Vika was studying her favorite internet resource - Wikipedia. On the expanses of Wikipedia, she read about an interesting mathematical operation bitwise XOR , denoted by $$$\\oplus$$$. Vika began to study the properties of this mysterious operation. To do this, she took an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers and applied the following operation to all its elements at the same time: $$$a_i = a_i \\oplus a_{(i+1) \\bmod n}$$$. Here $$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder of dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$. The elements of the array are numbered starting from $$$0$$$. Since it is not enough to perform the above actions once for a complete study, Vika repeats them until the array $$$a$$$ becomes all zeros. Determine how many of the above actions it will take to make all elements of the array $$$a$$$ zero. If this moment never comes, output $$$-1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2^{20}$$$) - the length of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ can be represented as $$$2^k$$$ for some integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le 20$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) - the elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Output a single number - the minimum number of actions required to make all elements of the array $$$a$$$ zero, or $$$-1$$$ if the array $$$a$$$ will never become zero.",
