  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$x_1$$$ and $$$p_1$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_1 \\le 10^6; 0 \\le p_1 \\le 10^6$$$) — the description of the first number. The second line of each testcase contains two integers $$$x_2$$$ and $$$p_2$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_2 \\le 10^6; 0 \\le p_2 \\le 10^6$$$) — the description of the second number.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase print the result of the comparison of the given two numbers. If the first number is smaller than the second one, print '<'. If the first number is greater than the second one, print '>'. If they are equal, print '='.",
