  "statement": "You're given integers $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$. For each integer $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, count the number of integer arrays $$$a$$$ such that all of the following are satisfied: $$$1 \\leq |a| \\leq n$$$ where $$$|a|$$$ represents the length of $$$a$$$. $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq k$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq |a|$$$. $$$a_1 \\times a_2 \\times \\dots \\times a_{|a|}=x$$$ (i.e., the product of all elements is $$$x$$$). Note that two arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are different if either their lengths are different, or if there exists an index $$$1 \\leq i \\leq |b|$$$ such that $$$b_i\\neq c_i$$$. Output the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t\\leq 10^3$$$) â€” the number of independent test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^5, 1\\leq n \\leq 9\\cdot 10^8$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$k$$$ space-separated integers on a new line: the number of arrays for $$$x=1,2,\\ldots,k$$$, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
