  "statement": "Sakurako and Kosuke decided to play some games with a dot on a coordinate line. The dot is currently located in position $$$x=0$$$. They will be taking turns, and Sakurako will be the one to start . On the $$$i$$$-th move, the current player will move the dot in some direction by $$$2\\cdot i-1$$$ units. Sakurako will always be moving the dot in the negative direction, whereas Kosuke will always move it in the positive direction. In other words, the following will happen: Sakurako will change the position of the dot by $$$-1$$$, $$$x = -1$$$ now Kosuke will change the position of the dot by $$$3$$$, $$$x = 2$$$ now Sakurako will change the position of the dot by $$$-5$$$, $$$x = -3$$$ now $$$\\cdots$$$ They will keep on playing while the absolute value of the coordinate of the dot does not exceed $$$n$$$. More formally, the game continues while $$$-n\\le x\\le n$$$. It can be proven that the game will always end. Your task is to determine who will be the one who makes the last turn.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 100$$$) — the number of games that Sakurako and Kosuke played. Each game is described by one number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n\\le 100$$$) — the number that defines the condition when the game ends.",
  "outputFormat": "For each of the $$$t$$$ games, output a line with the result of that game. If Sakurako makes the last turn, output \" Sakurako \" (without quotes); else output \" Kosuke \".",
