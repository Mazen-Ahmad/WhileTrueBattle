  "statement": "You received an $$$n\\times m$$$ grid from a mysterious source. The source also gave you a magic positive integer constant $$$k$$$. The source told you to color the grid with some colors, satisfying the following condition: If $$$(x_1,y_1)$$$, $$$(x_2,y_2)$$$ are two distinct cells with the same color, then $$$\\max(|x_1-x_2|,|y_1-y_2|)\\ge k$$$. You don't like using too many colors. Please find the minimum number of colors needed to color the grid.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case consists of three positive integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\le n,m,k\\le10^4$$$) — the dimensions of the grid and the magic constant.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of colors needed to color the grid.",
