  "statement": "Kawashiro Nitori is a girl who loves competitive programming. One day she found a rooted tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. The root is vertex $$$1$$$. As an advanced problem setter, she quickly thought of a problem. Kawashiro Nitori has a vertex set $$$U=\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$$$. She's going to play a game with the tree and the set. In each operation, she will choose a vertex set $$$T$$$, where $$$T$$$ is a partial virtual tree of $$$U$$$, and change $$$U$$$ into $$$T$$$. A vertex set $$$S_1$$$ is a partial virtual tree of a vertex set $$$S_2$$$, if $$$S_1$$$ is a subset of $$$S_2$$$, $$$S_1 \\neq S_2$$$, and for all pairs of vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ in $$$S_1$$$, $$$\\operatorname{LCA}(i,j)$$$ is in $$$S_1$$$, where $$$\\operatorname{LCA}(x,y)$$$ denotes the lowest common ancestor of vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ on the tree. Note that a vertex set can have many different partial virtual trees. Kawashiro Nitori wants to know for each possible $$$k$$$, if she performs the operation exactly $$$k$$$ times, in how many ways she can make $$$U=\\{1\\}$$$ in the end? Two ways are considered different if there exists an integer $$$z$$$ ($$$1 \\le z \\le k$$$) such that after $$$z$$$ operations the sets $$$U$$$ are different. Since the answer could be very large, you need to find it modulo $$$p$$$. It's guaranteed that $$$p$$$ is a prime number.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$p$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2000$$$, $$$10^8 + 7 \\le p \\le 10^9+9$$$). It's guaranteed that $$$p$$$ is a prime number. Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n$$$), representing an edge between $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.",
