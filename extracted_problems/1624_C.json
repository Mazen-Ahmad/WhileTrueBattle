  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You can perform operations on it. In one operation you can replace any element of the array $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\lfloor \\frac{a_i}{2} \\rfloor$$$, that is, by an integer part of dividing $$$a_i$$$ by $$$2$$$ (rounding down). See if you can apply the operation some number of times (possible $$$0$$$) to make the array $$$a$$$ become a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ —that is, so that it contains all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, each exactly once. For example, if $$$a = [1, 8, 25, 2]$$$, $$$n = 4$$$, then the answer is yes. You could do the following: Replace $$$8$$$ with $$$\\lfloor \\frac{8}{2} \\rfloor = 4$$$, then $$$a = [1, 4, 25, 2]$$$. Replace $$$25$$$ with $$$\\lfloor \\frac{25}{2} \\rfloor = 12$$$, then $$$a = [1, 4, 12, 2]$$$. Replace $$$12$$$ with $$$\\lfloor \\frac{12}{2} \\rfloor = 6$$$, then $$$a = [1, 4, 6, 2]$$$. Replace $$$6$$$ with $$$\\lfloor \\frac{6}{2} \\rfloor = 3$$$, then $$$a = [1, 4, 3, 2]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) —the number of test cases. Each test case contains exactly two lines. The first one contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$), the second one contains integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output on a separate line: YES if you can make the array $$$a$$$ become a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, NO otherwise. You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).",
