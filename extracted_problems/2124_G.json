  "statement": "This problem differs from problem B. In this problem, you must output the maximum sum of prefix minimums over all operations that cost at least $$$x$$$ for each integer $$$x$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, with elements satisfying $$$\\boldsymbol{0 \\le a_i \\le n}$$$. You can perform the following operation at most once : Choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$. Set $$$a_i := a_i + a_j$$$. Then, set $$$a_j = 0$$$. Let the cost of one operation be the value of $$$j-i$$$. The cost of not performing an operation is $$$0$$$. For each integer $$$x$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ inclusive, output the maximum possible value of $$$\\min(a_1) + \\min(a_1,a_2) + \\ldots + \\min(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$$$ over all possible operations that have a cost of at least $$$x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The following line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — denoting the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers on a new line: the $$$i$$$-th integer denoting the maximum answer over all operations that have a cost of at least $$$i-1$$$.",
