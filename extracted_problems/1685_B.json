  "statement": "Alina has discovered a weird language, which contains only $$$4$$$ words: $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$. It also turned out that there are no spaces in this language: a sentence is written by just concatenating its words into a single string. Alina has found one such sentence $$$s$$$ and she is curious: is it possible that it consists of precisely $$$a$$$ words $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$b$$$ words $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$c$$$ words $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and $$$d$$$ words $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$? In other words, determine, if it's possible to concatenate these $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words in some order so that the resulting string is $$$s$$$. Each of the $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words must be used exactly once in the concatenation, but you can choose the order in which they are concatenated.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ ($$$0\\le a,b,c,d\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of times that words $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$ respectively must be used in the sentence. The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$s$$$ consists only of the characters $$$\\texttt{A}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$1\\le |s| \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$|s|=a+b+2c+2d$$$) — the sentence. Notice that the condition $$$|s|=a+b+2c+2d$$$ (here $$$|s|$$$ denotes the length of the string $$$s$$$) is equivalent to the fact that $$$s$$$ is as long as the concatenation of the $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words. The sum of the lengths of $$$s$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if it is possible that the sentence $$$s$$$ consists of precisely $$$a$$$ words $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$b$$$ words $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$c$$$ words $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and $$$d$$$ words $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.",
