  "statement": "Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$, a permutation$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is called funny if $$$p_i$$$ is a multiple of $$$i$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n - 1$$$, $$$p_n = 1$$$, and $$$p_1 = x$$$. Find the lexicographically minimal$$$^{\\ddagger}$$$ funny permutation, or report that no such permutation exists. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of each of the integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once. $$$^{\\ddagger}$$$ Let $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ be permutations of length $$$n$$$. Then $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$b$$$ if in the first position $$$i$$$ where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, $$$a_i < b_i$$$. A permutation is lexicographically minimal if it is lexicographically smaller than all other permutations.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 < x \\leq n$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if the answer exists, output $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$) — the lexicographically minimal funny permutation $$$p$$$. Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$.",
