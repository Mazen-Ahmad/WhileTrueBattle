  "statement": "You are given $$$3$$$ integers — $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$. Let's call the score of a permutation$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$p_1, \\ldots, p_n$$$ the following value: $$$$$$(p_{1 \\cdot x} + p_{2 \\cdot x} + \\ldots + p_{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{x} \\rfloor \\cdot x}) - (p_{1 \\cdot y} + p_{2 \\cdot y} + \\ldots + p_{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{y} \\rfloor \\cdot y})$$$$$$ In other words, the score of a permutation is the sum of $$$p_i$$$ for all indices $$$i$$$ divisible by $$$x$$$, minus the sum of $$$p_i$$$ for all indices $$$i$$$ divisible by $$$y$$$. You need to find the maximum possible score among all permutations of length $$$n$$$. For example, if $$$n = 7$$$, $$$x = 2$$$, $$$y = 3$$$, the maximum score is achieved by the permutation $$$[2,\\color{red}{\\underline{\\color{black}{6}}},\\color{blue}{\\underline{\\color{black}{1}}},\\color{red}{\\underline{\\color{black}{7}}},5,\\color{blue}{\\underline{\\color{red}{\\underline{\\color{black}{4}}}}},3]$$$ and is equal to $$$(6 + 7 + 4) - (1 + 4) = 17 - 5 = 12$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in any order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation (the number $$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$, but the array contains $$$4$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of each test case. The only line of each test case description contains $$$3$$$ integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\le x, y \\le n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum score among all permutations of length $$$n$$$.",
