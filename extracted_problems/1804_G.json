  "statement": "Raj has a single physical network line that connects his office to the Internet. This line bandwidth is $$$b$$$ bytes per millisecond. There are $$$n$$$ users who would like to use this network line to transmit some data. The $$$i$$$-th of them will use the line from millisecond $$$s_i$$$ to millisecond $$$f_i$$$ inclusive. His initial data rate will be set to $$$d_i$$$. That means he will use data rate equal to $$$d_i$$$ for millisecond $$$s_i$$$, and then it will change according to the procedure described below. The flow control will happen as follows. Suppose there are $$$m$$$ users trying to transmit some data via the given network line during millisecond $$$x$$$. Denote as $$$t_i$$$ the data rate that the $$$i$$$-th of these $$$m$$$ users has at the beginning of this millisecond. All $$$t_i$$$ are non-negative integer values. If $$$m = 0$$$, i. e. there are no users trying to transmit data during this millisecond, nothing happens. If the sum of all $$$t_i$$$ is less than or equal to $$$b$$$, each active user successfully completes his transmission (the $$$i$$$-th active user transmits $$$t_i$$$ bytes). After that, the data rate of each active user grows by $$$1$$$, i. e. each $$$t_i$$$ is increased by $$$1$$$. If the sum of all $$$t_i$$$ is greater than $$$b$$$, the congestion occurs and no data transmissions succeed this millisecond at all. If that happens, each $$$t_i$$$ decreases twice, i. e. each $$$t_i$$$ is replaced with $$$\\lfloor \\frac{t_i}{2} \\rfloor$$$. Raj knows all the values $$$n$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$s_i$$$, $$$f_i$$$, and $$$d_i$$$, he wants to calculate the total number of bytes transmitted by all the users in the aggregate.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq b \\leq 10^9$$$), the number of users who will use the line and the line bandwidth, respectively. Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$s_i$$$, $$$f_i$$$ and $$$d_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s_i \\leq f_i \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\leq d_i \\leq 10^9$$$), denoting that the $$$i$$$-th user will try to transmit data during each millisecond between $$$s_i$$$ and $$$f_i$$$ inclusive, and the initial data rate of the $$$i$$$-th user.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer — the total number of bytes all users will successfully transmit.",
