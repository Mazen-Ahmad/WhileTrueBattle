  "statement": "Iris likes full binary trees. Let's define the depth of a rooted tree as the maximum number of vertices on the simple paths from some vertex to the root. A full binary tree of depth $$$d$$$ is a binary tree of depth $$$d$$$ with exactly $$$2^d - 1$$$ vertices. Iris calls a tree a $$$d$$$-binary tree if some vertices and edges can be added to it to make it a full binary tree of depth $$$d$$$. Note that any vertex can be chosen as the root of a full binary tree. Since performing operations on large trees is difficult, she defines the binary depth of a tree as the minimum $$$d$$$ satisfying that the tree is $$$d$$$-binary. Specifically, if there is no integer $$$d \\ge 1$$$ such that the tree is $$$d$$$-binary, the binary depth of the tree is $$$-1$$$. Iris now has a tree consisting of only vertex $$$1$$$. She wants to add $$$n - 1$$$ more vertices to form a larger tree. She will add the vertices one by one. When she adds vertex $$$i$$$ ($$$2 \\leq i \\leq n$$$), she'll give you an integer $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i < i$$$), and add a new edge connecting vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$. Iris wants to ask you the binary depth of the tree formed by the first $$$i$$$ vertices for each $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. Can you tell her the answer?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the final size of the tree. The second line of each test case contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i < i$$$) — descriptions of all edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output $$$n$$$ integers, $$$i$$$-th of them representing the binary depth of the tree formed by the first $$$i$$$ vertices.",
