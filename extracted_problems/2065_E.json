  "statement": "With the approach of Valentine's Day, Skibidus desperately needs a way to rizz up his crush! Fortunately, he knows of just the way: creating the perfect Binary String! Given a binary string$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$t$$$, let $$$x$$$ represent the number of $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ in $$$t$$$ and $$$y$$$ represent the number of $$$\\texttt{1}$$$ in $$$t$$$. Its balance-value is defined as the value of $$$\\max(x-y, y-x)$$$. Skibidus gives you three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$. He asks for your help to construct a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n+m$$$ with exactly $$$n$$$ $$$\\texttt{0}$$$'s and $$$m$$$ $$$\\texttt{1}$$$'s such that the maximum balance-value among all of its substrings$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ is exactly $$$k$$$. If it is not possible, output -1 . $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A binary string only consists of characters $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\leq n, m \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq n + m$$$, $$$n+m\\geq 1$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is possible to construct $$$s$$$, output it on a new line. If there are multiple possible $$$s$$$, output any. Otherwise, output -1 on a new line.",
