  "statement": "You have two strings $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: Choose a positive integer $$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$. Swap the prefix of the string $$$s_1$$$ and the suffix of the string $$$s_2$$$ of length $$$k$$$. Is it possible to make these two strings equal by doing described operations?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the strings $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$. The second line contains the string $$$s_1$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. The third line contains the string $$$s_2$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" YES \" if it is possible to make the strings equal, and \" NO \" otherwise.",
