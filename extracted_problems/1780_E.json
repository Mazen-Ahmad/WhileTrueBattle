  "statement": "Josuke received a huge undirected weighted complete$$$^\\dagger$$$ graph $$$G$$$ as a gift from his grandfather. The graph contains $$$10^{18}$$$ vertices. The peculiarity of the gift is that the weight of the edge between the different vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ is equal to $$$\\gcd(u, v)^\\ddagger$$$. Josuke decided to experiment and make a new graph $$$G'$$$. To do this, he chooses two integers $$$l \\le r$$$ and deletes all vertices except such vertices $$$v$$$ that $$$l \\le v \\le r$$$, and also deletes all the edges except between the remaining vertices. Now Josuke is wondering how many different weights are there in $$$G'$$$. Since their count turned out to be huge, he asks for your help. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A complete graph is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is adjacent. $$$^\\ddagger$$$ $$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two numbers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^{18}$$$, $$$l \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single number — the number of different weights among the remaining edges.",
