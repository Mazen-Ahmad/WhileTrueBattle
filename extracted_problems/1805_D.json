  "statement": "You are given a tree (a connected graph without cycles) with $$$n$$$ vertices. Consider a fixed integer $$$k$$$. Then, the graph $$$G_k$$$ is an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices, where an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ exists if and only if the distance between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in the given tree is at least $$$k$$$. For each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, print the number of connected components in the graph $$$G_k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) â€” the number of vertices in the graph. Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$), denoting an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in the tree. It is guaranteed that these edges form a valid tree.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$n$$$ integers: the number of connected components in the graph $$$G_k$$$ for each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.",
