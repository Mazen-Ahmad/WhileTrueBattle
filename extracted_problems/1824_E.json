  "statement": "LuoTianyi is watching the anime Made in Abyss . She finds that making a Cartridge is interesting. To describe the process of making a Cartridge more clearly, she abstracts the original problem and gives you the following problem. You are given a tree $$$T$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Each vertex has values $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ and each edge has values $$$c_j$$$ and $$$d_j$$$. Now you are aim to build a tree $$$T'$$$ as follows: First, select $$$p$$$ vertices from $$$T$$$ ($$$p$$$ is a number chosen by yourself) as the vertex set $$$S'$$$ of $$$T'$$$. Next, select $$$p-1$$$ edges from $$$T$$$ one by one (you cannot select one edge more than once). May you have chosen the $$$j$$$-th edge connects vertices $$$x_j$$$ and $$$y_j$$$ with values $$$(c_j,d_j)$$$, then you can choose two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in $$$S'$$$ that satisfy the edge $$$(x_j,y_j)$$$ is contained in the simple path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ in $$$T$$$, and link $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in $$$T'$$$ by the edge with values $$$(c_j,d_j)$$$ ($$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ shouldn't be contained in one connected component before in $$$T'$$$). A tree with three vertices, $$$\\min(A,C)=1,B+D=7$$$, the cost is $$$7$$$. Selected vertices $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ as $$$S'$$$, used the edge $$$(1,2)$$$ with $$$c_j = 2$$$ and $$$d_j = 1$$$ to link this vertices, now $$$\\min(A,C)=2,B+D=4$$$, the cost is $$$8$$$. Let $$$A$$$ be the minimum of values $$$a_i$$$ in $$$T'$$$ and $$$C$$$ be the minimum of values $$$c_i$$$ in $$$T'$$$. Let $$$B$$$ be the sum of $$$b_i$$$ in $$$T'$$$ and $$$D$$$ be the sum of values $$$d_i$$$ in $$$T'$$$. Let $$$\\min(A, C) \\cdot (B + D)$$$ be the cost of $$$T'$$$. You need to find the maximum possible cost of $$$T'$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3\\le n \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree $$$T$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$), where the $$$i$$$-th integer represents the $$$a_i$$$ value of the $$$i$$$-th vertex. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1\\le b_i\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$), where the $$$i$$$-th integer represents the $$$b_i$$$ value of the $$$i$$$-th vertex. Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follow, the $$$j$$$-th of them contains four integers $$$x_j,y_j,c_j,d_j$$$ ($$$1\\le x_j,y_j\\le n,1\\le c_j,d_j\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) representing the edge $$$(x_j,y_j)$$$ and its values $$$c_j$$$ and $$$d_j$$$ respectively. It's guaranteed that edges form a tree.",
