  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$. You have to change the minimum number of digits in it in such a way that the resulting number does not have any leading zeroes and is divisible by $$$7$$$ . If there are multiple ways to do it, print any of them. If the given number is already divisible by $$$7$$$, leave it unchanged.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 990$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow, each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$10 \\le n \\le 999$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer without any leading zeroes — the result of your changes (i. e. the integer that is divisible by $$$7$$$ and can be obtained by changing the minimum possible number of digits in $$$n$$$). If there are multiple ways to apply changes, print any resulting number. If the given number is already divisible by $$$7$$$, just print it.",
