  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, the limits on $$$n$$$ and the time limit are smaller. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. You are given an integer $$$n$$$, and you need to compute $$$(\\sum_{k=1}^n k\\bmod\\varphi(k))\\bmod 2^{32}$$$, where $$$\\varphi(k)$$$ equals the number of positive integers no greater than $$$k$$$ that are coprime with $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{10})$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer, representing $$$(\\sum_{k=1}^n k\\bmod\\varphi(k))\\bmod 2^{32}$$$.",
