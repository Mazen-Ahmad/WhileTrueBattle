  "statement": "Recently, Misha at the IT Campus \"NEIMARK\" camp learned a new topic — the Euclidean algorithm. He was somewhat surprised when he realized that $$$a \\cdot b = lcm(a, b) \\cdot gcd(a, b)$$$, where $$$gcd(a, b)$$$ — is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ and $$$lcm(a, b)$$$ — is the least common multiple (LCM) . Misha thought that since the product of LCM and GCD exists, it might be interesting to consider their quotient: $$$F(a,b)=\\frac{lcm(a, b)}{gcd(a, b)}$$$. For example, he took $$$a = 2$$$ and $$$b = 4$$$, computed $$$F(2, 4) = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$$$ and obtained a prime number (a number is prime if it has exactly two divisors)! Now he considers $$$F(a, b)$$$ to be an interesting ratio if $$$a < b$$$ and $$$F(a, b)$$$ is a prime number. Since Misha has just started studying number theory, he needs your help to calculate — how many different pairs of numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are there such that $$$F(a, b)$$$ is an interesting ratio and $$$1 \\leq a < b \\leq n$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows. A single line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^7$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^7$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the number of interesting ratios $$$F(a, b)$$$ for pairs satisfying $$$1 \\leq a < b \\leq n$$$.",
