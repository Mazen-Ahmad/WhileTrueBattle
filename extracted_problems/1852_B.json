  "statement": "Ntarsis has come up with an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. Call an array $$$b$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers imbalanced if it satisfies the following: $$$-n\\le b_i\\le n$$$, $$$b_i \\ne 0$$$, there are no two indices $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$) such that $$$b_i + b_j = 0$$$, for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, there are exactly $$$a_i$$$ indices $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j \\le n$$$) such that $$$b_i+b_j>0$$$, where $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are not necessarily distinct. Given the array $$$a$$$, Ntarsis wants you to construct some imbalanced array. Help him solve this task, or determine it is impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case has a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$). The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" NO \" if there exists no imbalanced array. Otherwise, output \" YES \". Then, on the next line, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ where $$$b_i \\neq 0$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ â€” an imbalanced array.",
