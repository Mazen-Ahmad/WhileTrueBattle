  "statement": "You are given a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Recall that a tree is an undirected connected acyclic graph. The given tree is rooted at the vertex $$$1$$$. You have to process $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, you are given a vertex of the tree $$$v$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$. To process a query, you may delete any vertices from the tree in any order, except for the root and the vertex $$$v$$$. When a vertex is deleted, its children become the children of its parent. You have to process a query in such a way that maximizes the value of $$$c(v) - m \\cdot k$$$ (where $$$c(v)$$$ is the resulting number of children of the vertex $$$v$$$, and $$$m$$$ is the number of vertices you have deleted). Print the maximum possible value you can obtain. The queries are independent: the changes you make to the tree while processing a query don't affect the tree in other queries.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree. Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$; $$$x_i \\ne y_i$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th edge. These edges form a tree. The next line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, the $$$j$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$v_j$$$ and $$$k_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le v_j \\le n$$$; $$$0 \\le k_j \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the parameters of the $$$j$$$-th query.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print one integer — the maximum value of $$$c(v) - m \\cdot k$$$ you can achieve.",
