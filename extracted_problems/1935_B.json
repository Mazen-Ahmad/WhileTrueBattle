  "statement": "In the Master's Assistance Center, Nyam-Nyam was given a homework assignment in informatics. There is an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, and you want to divide it into $$$k > 1$$$ subsegments$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ in such a way that the $$$\\operatorname{MEX} ^{\\ddagger}$$$ on each subsegment is equal to the same integer. Help Nyam-Nyam find any suitable division, or determine that it does not exist. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$A division of an array into $$$k$$$ subsegments is defined as $$$k$$$ pairs of integers $$$(l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), \\ldots, (l_k, r_k)$$$ such that $$$l_i \\le r_i$$$ and for each $$$1 \\le j \\le k - 1$$$, $$$l_{j + 1} = r_j + 1$$$, and also $$$l_1 = 1$$$ and $$$r_k = n$$$. These pairs represent the subsegments themselves. $$$^{\\ddagger}\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For example: $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of the array $$$[2, 2, 1]$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array. $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of the array $$$[3, 1, 0, 1]$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not. $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of the array $$$[0, 3, 1, 2]$$$ is $$$4$$$, because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$ belong to the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer $$$-1$$$ if a suitable division does not exist. Otherwise, on the first line, output an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le k \\le n$$$) — the number of subsegments in the division. Then output $$$k$$$ lines — the division into subsegments. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$) — the boundaries of the $$$i$$$-th subsegment. The following conditions must be satisfied: For all $$$1 \\le j \\le k - 1$$$, $$$l_{j + 1} = r_j + 1$$$; $$$l_1 = 1$$$, $$$r_k = n$$$. If there are multiple possible solutions, output any of them.",
