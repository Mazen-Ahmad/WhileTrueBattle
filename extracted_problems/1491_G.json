  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ coins labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Initially, coin $$$c_i$$$ is on position $$$i$$$ and is facing upwards (($$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n)$$$ is a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$). You can do some operations on these coins. In one operation, you can do the following: Choose $$$2$$$ distinct indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$. Then, swap the coins on positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$. Then, flip both coins on positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$. (If they are initially faced up, they will be faced down after the operation and vice versa) Construct a sequence of at most $$$n+1$$$ operations such that after performing all these operations the coin $$$i$$$ will be on position $$$i$$$ at the end, facing up . Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of coins. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le n$$$, $$$c_i \\neq c_j$$$ for $$$i\\neq j$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "In the first line, output an integer $$$q$$$ $$$(0 \\leq q \\leq n+1)$$$ — the number of operations you used. In the following $$$q$$$ lines, output two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ $$$(1 \\leq i, j \\leq n, i \\ne j)$$$ — the positions you chose for the current operation.",
