  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You are allowed to do the following operation: Select an array $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$ such that the following properties hold: $$$0 \\leq b_i \\leq a_i$$$ for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ There exists an index $$$1\\leq i < n$$$ such that $$$b_1+b_2+\\ldots+b_i=b_{i+1}+b_{i+2}+\\ldots+b_n$$$. That is, the sum of the prefix of length $$$i$$$ is equal to the sum of the suffix of length $$$n-i$$$. Then, subtract $$$b_i$$$ from $$$a_i$$$ for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. Your task is to change all the elements to $$$0$$$. Find the minimum number of operations required. Then, output a way to perform the operations. If it is impossible to change all the elements of $$$a$$$ to $$$0$$$ no matter how many operations are used, print $$$-1$$$ instead. It can be shown that under the constraints of this problem, the smallest number of operations required is at most $$$17$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 5\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^{12}$$$) — denoting the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$-1$$$ if there is no solution. Otherwise, first output an integer $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s \\leq 17$$$) – the minimum number of operations to change all the elements of $$$a$$$ to $$$0$$$. Then, in the next $$$s$$$ lines, output $$$n$$$ integers in each line $$$b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n (0 \\leq b_i \\leq a_i)$$$ — denoting the array $$$b$$$ for each operation. After performing the operations, all the elements of $$$a$$$ should be changed to $$$0$$$.",
