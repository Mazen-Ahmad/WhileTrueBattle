  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ children in a class, $$$m$$$ pairs among them are friends. The $$$i$$$-th pair who are friends have a friendship value of $$$f_i$$$. The teacher has to go for $$$k$$$ excursions, and for each of the excursions she chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by $$$1$$$ for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered $$$0$$$, and it does not change for subsequent excursions. Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all $$$k$$$ pairs chosen for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this answer can always be expressed as a fraction $$$\\dfrac{p}{q}$$$ where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are coprime integers. Calculate $$$p\\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod (10^9+7)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains $$$3$$$ integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le \\min \\Big(10^5$$$, $$$ \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\Big)$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions respectively. The next $$$m$$$ lines contain three integers each — $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$f_i$$$ — the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. ($$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$, $$$1 \\le a_i,b_i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le f_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that all pairs of friends are distinct . It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and sum $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.",
