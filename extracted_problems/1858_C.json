  "statement": "Alex got a new game called \"GCD permutations\" as a birthday present. Each round of this game proceeds as follows: First, Alex chooses a permutation$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Then, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, an integer $$$d_i = \\gcd(a_i, a_{(i \\bmod n) + 1})$$$ is calculated. The score of the round is the number of distinct numbers among $$$d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n$$$. Alex has already played several rounds so he decided to find a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ such that its score is as large as possible. Recall that $$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, and $$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder of dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the permutation with the largest possible score. If there are several permutations with the maximum possible score, you can print any one of them.",
