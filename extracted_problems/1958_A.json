  "statement": "In Berland, coins of worth $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ burles are commonly used (burles are local currency). Eva has to pay exactly $$$n$$$ burles in a shop. She has an infinite amount of coins of all three types. However, she doesn't like to pay using coins worth $$$1$$$ burle — she thinks they are the most convenient to use. Help Eva to calculate the minimum number of coins worth $$$1$$$ burle she has to use, if she has to pay exactly $$$n$$$ burles. Note that she can spend any number of coins worth $$$3$$$ and/or $$$5$$$ burles.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line, containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of $$$1$$$-burle coins Eva has to use.",
