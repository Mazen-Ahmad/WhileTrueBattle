  "statement": "For some positive integer $$$m$$$, YunQian considers an array $$$q$$$ of $$$2m$$$ (possibly negative) integers good , if and only if for every possible subsequence of $$$q$$$ that has length $$$m$$$, the product of the $$$m$$$ elements in the subsequence is equal to the sum of the $$$m$$$ elements that are not in the subsequence. Formally, let $$$U=\\{1,2,\\ldots,2m\\}$$$. For all sets $$$S \\subseteq U$$$ such that $$$|S|=m$$$, $$$\\prod\\limits_{i \\in S} q_i = \\sum\\limits_{i \\in U \\setminus S} q_i$$$. Define the distance between two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ both of length $$$k$$$ to be $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k|a_i-b_i|$$$. You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$ and an array $$$p$$$ of $$$2n$$$ integers. Find the minimum distance between $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ over all good arrays $$$q$$$ of length $$$2n$$$. It can be shown for all positive integers $$$n$$$, at least one good array exists. Note that you are not required to construct the array $$$q$$$ that achieves this minimum distance.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_{2n}$$$ ($$$|p_i| \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum distance between $$$p$$$ and a good $$$q$$$.",
