  "statement": "A permutation scientist is studying a self-transforming permutation $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ elements $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$. A permutation is a sequence of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ containing each number exactly once. For example, $$$[1]$$$, $$$[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]$$$ are permutations, while $$$[1, 1]$$$, $$$[4, 3, 1]$$$ are not. The permutation transforms day by day. On each day, each element $$$x$$$ becomes $$$a_x$$$, that is, $$$a_x$$$ becomes $$$a_{a_x}$$$. Specifically: on the first day, the permutation becomes $$$b$$$, where $$$b_x = a_{a_x}$$$; on the second day, the permutation becomes $$$c$$$, where $$$c_x = b_{b_x}$$$; $$$\\ldots$$$ For example, consider permutation $$$a = [2,3,1]$$$. On the first day, it becomes $$$[3,1,2]$$$. On the second day, it becomes $$$[2,3,1]$$$. You're given the permutation $$$a'$$$ on the $$$k$$$-th day. Define $$$\\sigma(x) = a_x$$$, and define $$$f(x)$$$ as the minimal positive integer $$$m$$$ such that $$$\\sigma^m(x) = x$$$, where $$$\\sigma^m(x)$$$ denotes $$$\\underbrace{\\sigma(\\sigma(\\ldots \\sigma}_{m \\text{ times}}(x) \\ldots))$$$. For example, if $$$a = [2,3,1]$$$, then $$$\\sigma(1) = 2$$$, $$$\\sigma^2(1) = \\sigma(\\sigma(1)) = \\sigma(2) = 3$$$, $$$\\sigma^3(1) = \\sigma(\\sigma(\\sigma(1))) = \\sigma(3) = 1$$$, so $$$f(1) = 3$$$. And if $$$a=[4,2,1,3]$$$, $$$\\sigma(2) = 2$$$ so $$$f(2) = 1$$$; $$$\\sigma(3) = 1$$$, $$$\\sigma^2(3) = 4$$$, $$$\\sigma^3(3) = 3$$$ so $$$f(3) = 3$$$. Find the initial permutation $$$a$$$ such that $$$\\sum\\limits^n_{i=1} \\dfrac{1}{f(i)}$$$ is minimum possible .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$, and the last day. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a'_1,a'_2,\\ldots,a'_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a'_i \\le n$$$) — the permutation on the $$$k$$$-th day. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if at least one initial $$$a$$$ consistent with the given $$$a'$$$ exists, print \" YES \", then print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ — the initial permutation with the smallest sum $$$\\sum\\limits^n_{i=1} \\dfrac{1}{f(i)}$$$. If there are multiple answers with the smallest sum, print any. If there are no valid permutations, print \" NO \".",
