  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ points and $$$m$$$ segments on the coordinate line. The initial coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th point is $$$a_i$$$. The endpoints of the $$$j$$$-th segment are $$$l_j$$$ and $$$r_j$$$ — left and right endpoints, respectively. You can move the points. In one move you can move any point from its current coordinate $$$x$$$ to the coordinate $$$x - 1$$$ or the coordinate $$$x + 1$$$. The cost of this move is $$$1$$$. You should move the points in such a way that each segment is visited by at least one point. A point visits the segment $$$[l, r]$$$ if there is a moment when its coordinate was on the segment $$$[l, r]$$$ (including endpoints). You should find the minimal possible total cost of all moves such that all segments are visited.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of points and segments respectively. The next line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the initial coordinates of the points. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_j$$$, $$$r_j$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le l_j \\le r_j \\le 10^9$$$) — the left and the right endpoints of the $$$j$$$-th segment. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single integer — the minimal total cost of all moves such that all segments are visited.",
