  "statement": "Kinich wakes up to the start of a new day. He turns on his phone, checks his mailbox, and finds a mysterious present. He decides to unbox the present. Kinich unboxes an array $$$a$$$ with $$$n$$$ integers. Initially, Kinich's score is $$$0$$$. He will perform the following operation any number of times: Select two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ $$$(1 \\leq i < j \\leq n)$$$ such that neither $$$i$$$ nor $$$j$$$ has been chosen in any previous operation and $$$a_i = a_j$$$. Then, add $$$1$$$ to his score. Output the maximum score Kinich can achieve after performing the aforementioned operation any number of times.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 20$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The following line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum score achievable on a new line.",
