  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. Alice and Bob are playing a game. There is $$$n\\times n$$$ grid, initially empty. We refer to the cell in row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ by $$$(i, j)$$$ for $$$1\\le i, j\\le n$$$. There is an infinite supply of tokens that come in $$$3$$$ colors labelled $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$. The game proceeds with turns as follows. Each turn begins with Alice naming one of the three colors, let's call it $$$a$$$. Then, Bob chooses a color $$$b\\ne a$$$, chooses an empty cell, and places a token of color $$$b$$$ on that cell. We say that there is a conflict if there exist two adjacent cells containing tokens of the same color. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a common edge. If at any moment there is a conflict, Alice wins. Otherwise, if $$$n^2$$$ turns are completed (so that the grid becomes full) without any conflicts, Bob wins. We have a proof that Bob has a winning strategy. Play the game as Bob and win. The interactor is adaptive . That is, Alice's color choices can depend on Bob's previous moves.",
