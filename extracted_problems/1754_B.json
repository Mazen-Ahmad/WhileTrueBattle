  "statement": "For his birthday, Kevin received the set of pairwise distinct numbers $$$1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$$$ as a gift. He is going to arrange these numbers in a way such that the minimum absolute difference between two consecutive numbers be maximum possible. More formally, if he arranges numbers in order $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$, he wants to maximize the value $$$$$$\\min \\limits_{i=1}^{n - 1} \\lvert p_{i + 1} - p_i \\rvert,$$$$$$ where $$$|x|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$x$$$. Help Kevin to do that.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\leq 1\\,000$$$) — the size of the set.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single line containing $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) describing the arrangement that maximizes the minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements. Formally, you have to print a permutation $$$p$$$ which maximizes the value $$$\\min \\limits_{i=1}^{n - 1} \\lvert p_{i + 1} - p_i \\rvert$$$. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.",
