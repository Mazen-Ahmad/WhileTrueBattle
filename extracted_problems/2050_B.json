  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. In one operation, you can pick an index $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ inclusive, and do one of the following actions: Decrease $$$a_{i-1}$$$ by $$$1$$$, then increase $$$a_{i+1}$$$ by $$$1$$$. Decrease $$$a_{i+1}$$$ by $$$1$$$, then increase $$$a_{i-1}$$$ by $$$1$$$. After each operation, all the values must be non-negative. Can you make all the elements equal after any number of operations?",
  "inputFormat": "First line of input consists of one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. First line of each test case consists of one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$). Second line of each test case consists of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ of all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" YES \" without quotation marks if it is possible to make all the elements equal after any number of operations; otherwise, print \" NO \" without quotation marks. You can print answers in any register: \" yes \", \" YeS \", \" nO \" — will also be considered correct.",
