  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin characters. Count the number of nonempty strings $$$t \\neq$$$ \"$$$\\texttt{a}$$$\" such that it is possible to partition$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ $$$s$$$ into some substrings satisfying the following conditions: each substring either equals $$$t$$$ or \"$$$\\texttt{a}$$$\", and at least one substring equals $$$t$$$. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$ A partition of a string $$$s$$$ is an ordered sequence of some $$$k$$$ strings $$$t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_k$$$ (called substrings ) such that $$$t_1 + t_2 + \\ldots + t_k = s$$$, where $$$+$$$ represents the concatenation operation.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin characters ($$$2 \\leq |s| \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of nonempty strings $$$t \\neq$$$ \"$$$\\texttt{a}$$$\" that satisfy all constraints.",
