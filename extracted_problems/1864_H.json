  "statement": "Bogocubic is playing a game with amenotiomoi. First, Bogocubic fixed an integer $$$n$$$, and then he gave amenotiomoi an integer $$$x$$$ which is initially equal to $$$1$$$. In one move amenotiomoi performs one of the following operations with the same probability: increase $$$x$$$ by $$$1$$$; multiply $$$x$$$ by $$$2$$$. Bogocubic wants to find the expected number of moves amenotiomoi has to do to make $$$x$$$ greater than or equal to $$$n$$$. Help him find this number modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Formally, let $$$M = 998\\,244\\,353$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$y$$$ that $$$0 \\le y < M$$$ and $$$y \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer â€” the expected number of moves modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
