  "statement": "Let's denote the score of an array $$$b$$$ with $$$k$$$ elements as $$$\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^ib_j\\right)$$$. In other words, let $$$S_i$$$ denote the sum of the first $$$i$$$ elements of $$$b$$$. Then, the score can be denoted as $$$S_1+S_2+\\ldots+S_k$$$. Skibidus is given $$$n$$$ arrays $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$, each of which contains $$$m$$$ elements. Being the sigma that he is, he would like to concatenate them in any order to form a single array containing $$$n\\cdot m$$$ elements. Please find the maximum possible score Skibidus can achieve with his concatenated array! Formally, among all possible permutations$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, output the maximum score of $$$a_{p_1} + a_{p_2} + \\dots + a_{p_n}$$$, where $$$+$$$ represents concatenation$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ contains all integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$The concatenation of two arrays $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ with lengths $$$e$$$ and $$$f$$$ respectively (i.e. $$$c + d$$$) is $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_e, d_1, d_2, \\ldots d_f$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of arrays and the length of each array. The $$$i$$$'th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\ldots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_{i,j} \\leq 10^6$$$) — the elements of the $$$i$$$'th array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum score among all possible permutations $$$p$$$ on a new line.",
