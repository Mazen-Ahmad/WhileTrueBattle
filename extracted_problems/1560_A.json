  "statement": "Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by $$$3$$$ or end with the digit $$$3$$$ in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too. Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than $$$0$$$) integers which he likes: $$$1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, \\dots$$$. Output the $$$k$$$-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from $$$1$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le 1000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output in a separate line one integer $$$x$$$ — the $$$k$$$-th element of the sequence that was written out by Polycarp.",
