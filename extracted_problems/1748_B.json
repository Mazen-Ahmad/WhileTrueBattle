  "statement": "A non-empty digit string is diverse if the number of occurrences of each character in it doesn't exceed the number of distinct characters in it. For example: string \" 7 \" is diverse because 7 appears in it $$$1$$$ time and the number of distinct characters in it is $$$1$$$; string \" 77 \" is not diverse because 7 appears in it $$$2$$$ times and the number of distinct characters in it is $$$1$$$; string \" 1010 \" is diverse because both 0 and 1 appear in it $$$2$$$ times and the number of distinct characters in it is $$$2$$$; string \" 6668 \" is not diverse because 6 appears in it $$$3$$$ times and the number of distinct characters in it is $$$2$$$. You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of only digits $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$. Find how many of its $$$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$$ substrings are diverse. A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end. Note that if the same diverse string appears in $$$s$$$ multiple times, each occurrence should be counted independently. For example, there are two diverse substrings in \" 77 \" both equal to \" 7 \", so the answer for the string \" 77 \" is $$$2$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that all characters of $$$s$$$ are digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print one integer — the number of diverse substrings of the given string $$$s$$$.",
