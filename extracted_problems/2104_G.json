  "statement": "Surely, you have seen problems which require you to output the answer modulo $$$10^9+7$$$, $$$10^9+9$$$, or $$$998244353$$$. But have you ever seen a problem where you have to print the answer modulo $$$3$$$? You are given a functional graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. It is a directed graph, in which each vertex has exactly one outgoing arc. The graph is given as the array $$$g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_n$$$, where $$$g_i$$$ means that there is an arc that goes from $$$i$$$ to $$$g_i$$$. For some vertices, the outgoing arcs might be self-loops. Initially, all vertices of the graph are colored in color $$$1$$$. You can perform the following operation: select a vertex and a color from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, and then color this vertex and all vertices that are reachable from it. You can perform this operation any number of times (even zero). You should process $$$q$$$ queries. The query is described by three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$k$$$. For each query, you should: assign $$$g_x := y$$$; then calculate the number of different graph colorings for the given value of $$$k$$$ (two colorings are different if there exists at least one vertex that is colored in different colors in these two colorings); since the answer can be very large, print it modulo $$$3$$$ . Note that in every query, the initial coloring of the graph is reset (all vertices initially have color $$$1$$$ in each query).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le g_i \\le n$$$). The $$$q$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$; $$$1 \\le k_i \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print a single integer â€” the number of different graph colorings for the given value of $$$k$$$, taken modulo $$$3$$$.",
