  "statement": "Karel is a salesman in a car dealership. The dealership has $$$n$$$ different models of cars. There are $$$a_i$$$ cars of the $$$i$$$-th model. Karel is an excellent salesperson and can convince customers to buy up to $$$x$$$ cars (of Karel's choice), as long as the cars are from different models. Determine the minimum number of customers Karel has to bring in to sell all the cars.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le x \\le 10$$$) — the number of different models of cars and the maximum number of cars Karel can convince a customer to buy. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of cars of each model. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum possible number of customers needed to sell all the cars.",
