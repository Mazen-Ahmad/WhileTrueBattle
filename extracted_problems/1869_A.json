  "statement": "During Zhongkao examination, Reycloer met an interesting problem, but he cannot come up with a solution immediately. Time is running out! Please help him. Initially, you are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n \\ge 2$$$ integers, and you want to change all elements in it to $$$0$$$. In one operation, you select two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1\\le l\\le r\\le n$$$) and do the following: Let $$$s=a_l\\oplus a_{l+1}\\oplus \\ldots \\oplus a_r$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation ; Then, for all $$$l\\le i\\le r$$$, replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$s$$$. You can use the operation above in any order at most $$$8$$$ times in total. Find a sequence of operations, such that after performing the operations in order, all elements in $$$a$$$ are equal to $$$0$$$. It can be proven that the solution always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 100$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\\le a_i\\le 100$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, in the first line output a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\le k\\le 8$$$) — the number of operations you use. Then print $$$k$$$ lines, in the $$$i$$$-th line output two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1\\le l_i\\le r_i\\le n$$$) representing that you select $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ in the $$$i$$$-th operation. Note that you do not have to minimize $$$k$$$. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.",
