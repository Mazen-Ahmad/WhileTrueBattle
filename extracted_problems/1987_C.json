  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ flowers in a row, the $$$i$$$-th of them initially has a positive height of $$$h_i$$$ meters. Every second, the wind will blow from the left, causing the height of some flowers to decrease. Specifically, every second, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, in this order, the following happens: If $$$i = n$$$ or $$$h_i > h_{i + 1}$$$, the value of $$$h_i$$$ changes to $$$\\max(0, h_i - 1)$$$. How many seconds will pass before $$$h_i=0$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ for the first time?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of flowers. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le h_i \\le 10 ^ 9$$$) — the heights of the flowers. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
