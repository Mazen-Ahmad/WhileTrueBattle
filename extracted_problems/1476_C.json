  "statement": "You have $$$n$$$ chains, the $$$i$$$-th chain consists of $$$c_i$$$ vertices. Vertices in each chain are numbered independently from $$$1$$$ to $$$c_i$$$ along the chain. In other words, the $$$i$$$-th chain is the undirected graph with $$$c_i$$$ vertices and $$$(c_i - 1)$$$ edges connecting the $$$j$$$-th and the $$$(j + 1)$$$-th vertices for each $$$1 \\le j < c_i$$$. Now you decided to unite chains in one graph in the following way: the first chain is skipped; the $$$1$$$-st vertex of the $$$i$$$-th chain is connected by an edge with the $$$a_i$$$-th vertex of the $$$(i - 1)$$$-th chain; the last ($$$c_i$$$-th) vertex of the $$$i$$$-th chain is connected by an edge with the $$$b_i$$$-th vertex of the $$$(i - 1)$$$-th chain. Picture of the first test case. Dotted lines are the edges added during uniting process Calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph. A simple cycle is a chain where the first and last vertices are connected as well. If you travel along the simple cycle, each vertex of this cycle will be visited exactly once.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of chains you have. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$2 \\le c_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of vertices in the corresponding chains. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_1 = -1$$$; $$$1 \\le a_i \\le c_{i - 1}$$$). The fourth line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$b_1 = -1$$$; $$$1 \\le b_i \\le c_{i - 1}$$$). Both $$$a_1$$$ and $$$b_1$$$ are equal to $$$-1$$$, they aren't used in graph building and given just for index consistency. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
