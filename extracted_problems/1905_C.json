  "statement": "Given is a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. In one operation you can select the lexicographically largest$$$^\\dagger$$$ subsequence of string $$$s$$$ and cyclic shift it to the right$$$^\\ddagger$$$. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations it would take for $$$s$$$ to become sorted, or report that it never reaches a sorted state. $$$^\\dagger$$$A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\ne b$$$; In the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$. $$$^\\ddagger$$$By cyclic shifting the string $$$t_1t_2\\ldots t_m$$$ to the right, we get the string $$$t_mt_1\\ldots t_{m-1}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to make $$$s$$$ sorted, or $$$-1$$$ if it's impossible.",
