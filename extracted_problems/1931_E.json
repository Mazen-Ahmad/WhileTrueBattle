  "statement": "Sasha gave Anna a list $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game. Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make the first move. On her turn, Anna must choose an element $$$a_i$$$ from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of $$$42$$$, it would become $$$24$$$; if Anna chose the element with a value of $$$1580$$$, it would become $$$851$$$. Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change. On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ ($$$i \\ne j$$$) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to $$$2007$$$ and $$$19$$$, he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer $$$200719$$$ or $$$192007$$$. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by $$$1$$$. Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e. after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this integer is not less than $$$10^m$$$ (i.e., $$$\\ge 10^m$$$), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna wins. It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both players play optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^6$$$) — the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output: \" Sasha \", if Sasha wins with optimal play; \" Anna \", if Anna wins with optimal play.",
