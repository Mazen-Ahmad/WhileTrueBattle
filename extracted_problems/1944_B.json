  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$2n$$$, consisting of each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly twice . You are also given an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor $$$). You need to find two arrays $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ each of length $$$\\mathbf{2k}$$$ such that: $$$l$$$ is a subset$$$^\\dagger$$$ of $$$[a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n]$$$ $$$r$$$ is a subset of $$$[a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \\ldots a_{2n}]$$$ bitwise XOR of elements of $$$l$$$ is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of $$$r$$$; in other words, $$$l_1 \\oplus l_2 \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \\oplus r_2 \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus r_{2k}$$$ It can be proved that at least one pair of $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subset of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained by deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of $$$y$$$ and rearranging the elements in any order. For example, $$$[3,1,2,1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 1]$$$ and $$$[3, 2]$$$ are subsets of $$$[1, 1, 2, 3]$$$ but $$$[4]$$$ and $$$[2, 2]$$$ are not subsets of $$$[1, 1, 2, 3]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 5000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor $$$). The second line contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly twice in $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output two lines. On the first line of output, output $$$2k$$$ integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_{2k}$$$. On the second line of output, output $$$2k$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \\ldots r_{2k}$$$. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.",
