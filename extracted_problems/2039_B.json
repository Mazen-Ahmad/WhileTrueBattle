  "statement": "For a string $$$p$$$, let $$$f(p)$$$ be the number of distinct non-empty substrings$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$p$$$. Shohag has a string $$$s$$$. Help him find a non-empty string $$$p$$$ such that $$$p$$$ is a substring of $$$s$$$ and $$$f(p)$$$ is even or state that no such string exists. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 10^5$$$) consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of the length of $$$s$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a non-empty string that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the statement, or $$$-1$$$ if no such string exists. If there are multiple solutions, output any.",
