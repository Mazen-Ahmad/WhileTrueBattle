  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, where all elements are different. You have to perform exactly $$$k$$$ operations with it. During each operation, you do exactly one of the following two actions (you choose which to do yourself): find two minimum elements in the array, and delete them; find the maximum element in the array, and delete it. You have to calculate the maximum possible sum of elements in the resulting array.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 99999$$$; $$$2k < n$$$) — the number of elements and operations, respectively. the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$; all $$$a_i$$$ are different) — the elements of the array. Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
