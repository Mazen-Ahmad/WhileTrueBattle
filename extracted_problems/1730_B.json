  "statement": "$$$n$$$ people live on the coordinate line, the $$$i$$$-th one lives at the point $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$). They want to choose a position $$$x_0$$$ to meet. The $$$i$$$-th person will spend $$$|x_i - x_0|$$$ minutes to get to the meeting place. Also, the $$$i$$$-th person needs $$$t_i$$$ minutes to get dressed, so in total he or she needs $$$t_i + |x_i - x_0|$$$ minutes. Here $$$|y|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$y$$$. These people ask you to find a position $$$x_0$$$ that minimizes the time in which all $$$n$$$ people can gather at the meeting place.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of people. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le x_i \\le 10^{8}$$$) — the positions of the people. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le t_i \\le 10^{8}$$$), where $$$t_i$$$ is the time $$$i$$$-th person needs to get dressed. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single real number — the optimum position $$$x_0$$$. It can be shown that the optimal position $$$x_0$$$ is unique. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{−6}$$$. Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer will be considered correct if $$$\\frac{|a−b|}{max(1,|b|)} \\le 10^{−6}$$$.",
