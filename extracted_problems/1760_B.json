  "statement": "In order to write a string, Atilla needs to first learn all letters that are contained in the string. Atilla needs to write a message which can be represented as a string $$$s$$$. He asks you what is the minimum alphabet size required so that one can write this message. The alphabet of size $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq 26$$$) contains only the first $$$x$$$ Latin letters. For example an alphabet of size $$$4$$$ contains only the characters $$$\\texttt{a}$$$, $$$\\texttt{b}$$$, $$$\\texttt{c}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{d}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the length of the string. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum alphabet size required to so that Atilla can write his message $$$s$$$.",
