  "statement": "The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved. You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$. Calculate the number of ordered pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ satisfying the following conditions: $$$1\\le a\\le n$$$, $$$1\\le b\\le m$$$; $$$a+b$$$ is a multiple of $$$b \\cdot \\gcd(a,b)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\le n,m\\le 2 \\cdot 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed that neither the sum of $$$n$$$ nor the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases exceeds $$$2 \\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.",
