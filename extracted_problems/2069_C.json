  "statement": "Let's call an integer sequence beautiful if the following conditions hold: its length is at least $$$3$$$; for every element except the first one, there is an element to the left less than it; for every element except the last one, there is an element to the right larger than it; For example, $$$[1, 4, 2, 4, 7]$$$ and $$$[1, 2, 4, 8]$$$ are beautiful, but $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[2, 2, 4]$$$, and $$$[1, 3, 5, 3]$$$ are not. Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. You are given an integer array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$, where every element is from $$$1$$$ to $$$3$$$ . Your task is to calculate the number of beautiful subsequences of the array $$$a$$$. Since the answer might be large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 3$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the number of beautiful subsequences of the array $$$a$$$, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
