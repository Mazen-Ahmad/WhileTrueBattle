  "statement": "Given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of integers. Then the following operation is sequentially applied to it $$$q$$$ times: Choose indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) and an integer $$$x$$$; Add $$$x$$$ to all elements of the array $$$a$$$ in the segment $$$[l, r]$$$. More formally, assign $$$a_i := a_i + x$$$ for all $$$l \\le i \\le r$$$. Let $$$b_j$$$ be the array $$$a$$$ obtained after applying the first $$$j$$$ operations ($$$0 \\le j \\le q$$$). Note that $$$b_0$$$ is the array $$$a$$$ before applying any operations. You need to find the lexicographically minimum$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ array among all arrays $$$b_j$$$. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$An array $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than array $$$y$$$ if there is an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$x_i < y_i$$$, and $$$x_j = y_j$$$ for all $$$j < i$$$. In other words, for the first index $$$i$$$ where the arrays differ, $$$x_i < y_i$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$0 \\le q \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of operations on the array. In each of the next $$$q$$$ lines, there are three integers $$$l_j$$$, $$$r_j$$$, and $$$x_j$$$ $$$(1 \\le l_j \\le r_j \\le n, -10^9 \\le x_j \\le 10^9)$$$ — the description of each operation. The operations are given in the order they are applied. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the lexicographically minimum array among all arrays $$$b_j$$$.",
