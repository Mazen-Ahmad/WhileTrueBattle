  "statement": "A sequence of positive integers is called great for a positive integer $$$x$$$, if we can split it into pairs in such a way that in each pair the first number multiplied by $$$x$$$ is equal to the second number. More formally, a sequence $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ is great for a positive integer $$$x$$$, if $$$n$$$ is even and there exists a permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$, such that for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le \\frac{n}{2}$$$) $$$a_{p_{2i-1}} \\cdot x = a_{p_{2i}}$$$. Sam has a sequence $$$a$$$ and a positive integer $$$x$$$. Help him to make the sequence great: find the minimum possible number of positive integers that should be added to the sequence $$$a$$$ to make it great for the number $$$x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 20\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\le x \\le 10^6$$$). The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of integers that can be added to the end of $$$a$$$ to make it a great sequence for the number $$$x$$$.",
