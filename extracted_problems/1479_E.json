  "statement": "In Homer's school, there are $$$n$$$ students who love clubs. Initially, there are $$$m$$$ clubs, and each of the $$$n$$$ students is in exactly one club. In other words, there are $$$a_i$$$ students in the $$$i$$$-th club for $$$1 \\leq i \\leq m$$$ and $$$a_1+a_2+\\dots+a_m = n$$$. The $$$n$$$ students are so unfriendly that every day one of them (chosen uniformly at random from all of the $$$n$$$ students) gets angry. The student who gets angry will do one of the following things. With probability $$$\\frac 1 2$$$, he leaves his current club, then creates a new club himself and joins it. There is only one student (himself) in the new club he creates. With probability $$$\\frac 1 2$$$, he does not create new clubs. In this case, he changes his club to a new one (possibly the same club he is in currently) with probability proportional to the number of students in it. Formally, suppose there are $$$k$$$ clubs and there are $$$b_i$$$ students in the $$$i$$$-th club for $$$1 \\leq i \\leq k$$$ (before the student gets angry). He leaves his current club, and then joins the $$$i$$$-th club with probability $$$\\frac {b_i} {n}$$$. We note that when a club becomes empty, students will never join it because any student who gets angry will join an empty club with probability $$$0$$$ according to the above statement. Homer wonders the expected number of days until every student is in the same club for the first time. We can prove that the answer can be represented as a rational number $$$\\frac p q$$$ with $$$\\gcd(p, q) = 1$$$. Therefore, you are asked to find the value of $$$pq^{-1} \\bmod 998\\,244\\,353$$$. It can be shown that $$$q \\bmod 998\\,244\\,353 \\neq 0$$$ under the given constraints of the problem.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of clubs initially. The second line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 4 \\cdot 10^8$$$) with $$$1 \\leq a_1+a_2+\\dots+a_m \\leq 4 \\cdot 10^8$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ denotes the number of students in the $$$i$$$-th club initially.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer — the expected number of days until every student is in the same club for the first time, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
