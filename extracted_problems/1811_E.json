  "statement": "In Japan, the number $$$4$$$ reads like death, so Bob decided to build a live sequence . Living sequence $$$a$$$ contains all natural numbers that do not contain the digit $$$4$$$. $$$a = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, \\ldots]$$$. For example, the number $$$1235$$$ is part of the sequence $$$a$$$, but the numbers $$$4321$$$, $$$443$$$ are not part of the sequence $$$a$$$. Bob realized that he does not know how to quickly search for a particular number by the position $$$k$$$ in the sequence, so he asks for your help. For example, if Bob wants to find the number at position $$$k = 4$$$ (indexing from $$$1$$$), you need to answer $$$a_k = 5$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. In the only line of each test case, there is a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le 10^{12}$$$) — the position Bob is interested in.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print on a separate line the number $$$a_k$$$ in indexing with $$$1$$$.",
