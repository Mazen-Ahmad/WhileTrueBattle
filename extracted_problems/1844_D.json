  "statement": "The row-major order of an $$$r \\times c$$$ grid of characters $$$A$$$ is the string obtained by concatenating all the rows, i.e. $$$$$$ A_{11}A_{12} \\dots A_{1c}A_{21}A_{22} \\dots A_{2c} \\dots A_{r1}A_{r2} \\dots A_{rc}. $$$$$$ A grid of characters $$$A$$$ is bad if there are some two adjacent cells (cells sharing an edge) with the same character. You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Consider all strings $$$s$$$ consisting of only lowercase Latin letters such that they are not the row-major order of any bad grid. Find any string with the minimum number of distinct characters among all such strings of length $$$n$$$. It can be proven that at least one such string exists under the constraints of the problem.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a string with the minimum number of distinct characters among all suitable strings of length $$$n$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
