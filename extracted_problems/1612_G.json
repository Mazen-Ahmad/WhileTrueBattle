  "statement": "You are given an array $$$c = [c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m]$$$. An array $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$$$ is constructed in such a way that it consists of integers $$$1, 2, \\dots, m$$$, and for each $$$i \\in [1,m]$$$, there are exactly $$$c_i$$$ occurrences of integer $$$i$$$ in $$$a$$$. So, the number of elements in $$$a$$$ is exactly $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} c_i$$$. Let's define for such array $$$a$$$ the value $$$f(a)$$$ as $$$$$$f(a) = \\sum_{\\substack{1 \\le i < j \\le n\\\\ a_i = a_j}}{j - i}.$$$$$$ In other words, $$$f(a)$$$ is the total sum of distances between all pairs of equal elements. Your task is to calculate the maximum possible value of $$$f(a)$$$ and the number of arrays yielding the maximum possible value of $$$f(a)$$$. Two arrays are considered different, if elements at some position differ.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$c$$$. The second line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le 10^6$$$) — the array $$$c$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print two integers — the maximum possible value of $$$f(a)$$$ and the number of arrays $$$a$$$ with such value. Since both answers may be too large, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
