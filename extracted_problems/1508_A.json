  "statement": "A bitstring is a string that contains only the characters 0 and 1 . Koyomi Kanou is working hard towards her dream of becoming a writer. To practice, she decided to participate in the Binary Novel Writing Contest . The writing prompt for the contest consists of three bitstrings of length $$$2n$$$. A valid novel for the contest is a bitstring of length at most $$$3n$$$ that contains at least two of the three given strings as subsequences. Koyomi has just received the three prompt strings from the contest organizers. Help her write a valid novel for the contest. A string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero) characters.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). Each of the following three lines contains a bitstring of length $$$2n$$$. It is guaranteed that these three strings are pairwise distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line containing a bitstring of length at most $$$3n$$$ that has at least two of the given bitstrings as subsequences. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, such a bitstring always exists. If there are multiple possible answers, you may output any of them.",
