  "statement": "A sequence of $$$n$$$ integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once. Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, construct a permutation $$$a$$$ of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ which has exactly $$$k$$$ peaks. An index $$$i$$$ of an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ is said to be a peak if $$$1 < i < n$$$ and $$$a_i \\gt a_{i-1}$$$ and $$$a_i \\gt a_{i+1}$$$. If such permutation is not possible, then print $$$-1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ lines follow, each containing two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\leq k \\leq n$$$) — the length of an array and the required number of peaks.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$t$$$ lines. For each test case, if there is no permutation with given length and number of peaks, then print $$$-1$$$. Otherwise print a line containing $$$n$$$ space-separated integers which forms a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and contains exactly $$$k$$$ peaks. If there are multiple answers, print any.",
