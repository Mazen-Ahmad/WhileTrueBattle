  "statement": "Artem wrote the digit $$$d$$$ on the board exactly $$$n!$$$ times in a row. So, he got the number $$$dddddd \\dots ddd$$$ (exactly $$$n!$$$ digits). Now he is curious about which odd digits from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ divide the number written on the board.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The next $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\le d \\le 9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the odd digits in ascending order that divide the number written on the board.",
