  "statement": "Let's say Pak Chanek has an array $$$A$$$ consisting of $$$N$$$ positive integers. Pak Chanek will do a number of operations. In each operation, Pak Chanek will do the following: Choose an index $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p \\leq N$$$). Let $$$c$$$ be the number of operations that have been done on index $$$p$$$ before this operation. Decrease the value of $$$A_p$$$ by $$$2^c$$$. Multiply the value of $$$A_p$$$ by $$$2$$$. After each operation, all elements of $$$A$$$ must be positive integers . An array $$$A$$$ is said to be sortable if and only if Pak Chanek can do zero or more operations so that $$$A_1 < A_2 < A_3 < A_4 < \\ldots < A_N$$$. Pak Chanek must find an array $$$A$$$ that is sortable with length $$$N$$$ such that $$$A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 + \\ldots + A_N$$$ is the minimum possible. If there are more than one possibilities, Pak Chanek must choose the array that is lexicographically minimum among them. Pak Chanek must solve the following things: Pak Chanek must print the value of $$$A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 + \\ldots + A_N$$$ for that array. $$$Q$$$ questions will be given. For the $$$i$$$-th question, an integer $$$P_i$$$ is given. Pak Chanek must print the value of $$$A_{P_i}$$$. Help Pak Chanek solve the problem. Note: an array $$$B$$$ of size $$$N$$$ is said to be lexicographically smaller than an array $$$C$$$ that is also of size $$$N$$$ if and only if there exists an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$B_i < C_i$$$ and for each $$$j < i$$$, $$$B_j = C_j$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$Q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$0 \\leq Q \\leq \\min(N, 10^5)$$$) — the required length of array $$$A$$$ and the number of questions. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$Q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$P_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq P_1 < P_2 < \\ldots < P_Q \\leq N$$$) — the index asked in the $$$i$$$-th question.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$Q+1$$$ lines. The $$$1$$$-st line contains an integer representing $$$A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 + \\ldots + A_N$$$. For each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq Q$$$, the $$$(i+1)$$$-th line contains an integer representing $$$A_{P_i}$$$.",
