  "statement": "You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. Your task is to count the number of pairs of integers $$$(i,j)$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$$$ and $$$a_i \\cdot a_j = b_i+b_j$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the arrays. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
