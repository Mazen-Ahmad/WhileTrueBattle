  "statement": "Turtle was playing with a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ consisting of positive integers. Unfortunately, some of the integers went missing while playing. Now the sequence becomes incomplete. There may exist an arbitrary number of indices $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i$$$ becomes $$$-1$$$. Let the new sequence be $$$a'$$$. Turtle is sad. But Turtle remembers that for every integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, either $$$a_i = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{a_{i + 1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$$ or $$$a_{i + 1} = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{a_i}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$$ holds for the original sequence $$$a$$$. Turtle wants you to help him complete the sequence. But sometimes Turtle makes mistakes, so you need to tell him if you can't complete the sequence. Formally, you need to find another sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ consisting of positive integers such that: For every integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, if $$$a'_i \\ne -1$$$, then $$$b_i = a'_i$$$. For every integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, either $$$b_i = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{b_{i + 1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$$ or $$$b_{i + 1} = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{b_i}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$$ holds. For every integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, $$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$. If there is no sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ that satisfies all of the conditions above, you need to report $$$-1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a'_1, a'_2, \\ldots, a'_n$$$ ($$$a'_i = -1$$$ or $$$1 \\le a'_i \\le 10^8$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$a'$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ that satisfies all of the conditions, output a single integer $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ — the elements of the sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ you find. The sequence should satisfy that $$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$ for every integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
