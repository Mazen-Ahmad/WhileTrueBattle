  "statement": "Even Little John needs money to buy a house. But he recently lost his job; how will he earn money now? Of course, by playing a game that gives him money as a reward! Oh well, maybe not those kinds of games you are thinking about. There are $$$n+m$$$ distinct points $$$(a_1,0), (a_2,0), \\ldots, (a_{n},0), (b_1,2), (b_2,2), \\ldots, (b_{m},2)$$$ on the plane. Initially, your score is $$$0$$$. To increase your score, you can perform the following operation: Choose three distinct points which are not collinear ; Increase your score by the area of the triangle formed by these three points; Then, erase the three points from the plane. An instance of the game, where the operation is performed twice. Let $$$k_{\\max}$$$ be the maximum number of operations that can be performed. For example, if it is impossible to perform any operation, $$$k_\\max$$$ is $$$0$$$. Additionally, define $$$f(k)$$$ as the maximum possible score achievable by performing the operation exactly $$$k$$$ times . Here, $$$f(k)$$$ is defined for all integers $$$k$$$ such that $$$0 \\le k \\le k_{\\max}$$$. Find the value of $$$k_{\\max}$$$, and find the values of $$$f(x)$$$ for all integers $$$x=1,2,\\ldots,k_{\\max}$$$ independently.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le {3 \\cdot 10^4}$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n,m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{n}$$$ — the points on $$$y=0$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_{m}$$$ — the points on $$$y=2$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that both the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, given that the maximum number of operations is $$$k_{\\max}$$$, you must output at most two lines: The first line contains the value of $$$k_{\\max}$$$; The second line contains $$$k_{\\max}$$$ integers denoting $$$f(1),f(2),\\ldots,f(k_{\\max})$$$. You are allowed to omit this line if $$$k_{\\max}$$$ is $$$0$$$. Note that under the constraints of this problem, it can be shown that all values of $$$f(x)$$$ are integers no greater than $$$10^{16}$$$.",
