  "statement": "Consider a rectangular parallelepiped with sides $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$, that consists of unit cubes of $$$k$$$ different colors. We can apply cyclic shifts to the parallelepiped in any of the three directions any number of times$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. There are $$$d_i$$$ cubes of the $$$i$$$-th color ($$$1 \\le i \\le k$$$). How many different parallelepipeds (with the given sides) can be formed from these cubes, no two of which can be made equal by some combination of cyclic shifts? $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$On the image: Top left shows the top view of the original parallelepiped. Lower layers will shift in the same way as the top layer. Top right shows the top view of a parallelepiped shifted to the right by $$$1$$$. Bottom left shows the top view of a parallelepiped shifted down by $$$2$$$. Bottom right shows the top view of a parallelepiped shifted to the right by $$$1$$$ and down by $$$2$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains four integers: $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b, c \\le 3 \\cdot 10^6$$$; $$$a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\le 3 \\cdot 10^6$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^6$$$) — three sides of the parallelepiped and the number of colors of unit cubes. The second line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le d_1 \\le d_2 \\le \\ldots \\le d_k \\le 3 \\cdot 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$d$$$: the number of cubes of a given color. It is guaranteed that in each test case the sum of the elements of the array $$$d$$$ is equal to $$$a \\cdot b \\cdot c$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10 ^ 6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the number of different parallelepipeds modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
