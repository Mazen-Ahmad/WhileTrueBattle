  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The array is called 3SUM-closed if for all distinct indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$, the sum $$$a_i + a_j + a_k$$$ is an element of the array. More formally, $$$a$$$ is 3SUM-closed if for all integers $$$1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq n$$$, there exists some integer $$$1 \\leq l \\leq n$$$ such that $$$a_i + a_j + a_k = a_l$$$. Determine if $$$a$$$ is 3SUM-closed.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" YES \" (without quotes) if $$$a$$$ is 3SUM-closed and \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output \" YES \" and \" NO \" in any case (for example, strings \" yEs \", \" yes \" and \" Yes \" will be recognized as a positive response).",
