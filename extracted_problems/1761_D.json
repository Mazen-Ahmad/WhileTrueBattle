  "statement": "Let $$$f(x,y)$$$ be the number of carries of $$$x+y$$$ in binary (i. e. $$$f(x,y)=g(x)+g(y)-g(x+y)$$$, where $$$g(x)$$$ is the number of ones in the binary representation of $$$x$$$). Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, find the number of ordered pairs $$$(a,b)$$$ such that $$$0 \\leq a,b < 2^n$$$, and $$$f(a,b)$$$ equals $$$k$$$. Note that for $$$a\\ne b$$$, $$$(a,b)$$$ and $$$(b,a)$$$ are considered as two different pairs. As this number may be large, output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The only line of each test contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\leq k<n\\leq 10^6$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Output a single integer â€” the answer modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
