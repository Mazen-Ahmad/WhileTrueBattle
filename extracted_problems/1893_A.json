  "statement": "You are given an array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$. An anonymous informant has told you that the array $$$b$$$ was obtained as follows: initially, there existed an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, after which the following two-component operation was performed $$$k$$$ times: A fixed point$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ $$$x$$$ of the array $$$a$$$ was chosen. Then, the array $$$a$$$ was cyclically shifted to the left$$$^{\\ddagger}$$$ exactly $$$x$$$ times. As a result of $$$k$$$ such operations, the array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ was obtained. You want to check if the words of the anonymous informant can be true or if they are guaranteed to be false. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$A number $$$x$$$ is called a fixed point of the array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ if $$$1 \\leq x \\leq n$$$ and $$$a_x = x$$$. $$$^{\\ddagger}$$$A cyclic left shift of the array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the array $$$a_2, \\ldots, a_n, a_1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$b$$$ and the number of operations performed. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" Yes \" if the words of the anonymous informant can be true, and \" No \" if they are guaranteed to be false.",
