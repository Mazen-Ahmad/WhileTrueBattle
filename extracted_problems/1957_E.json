  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$. The function $$$C(i,k)$$$ represents the number of distinct ways you can select $$$k$$$ distinct numbers from the set {$$$1, 2, \\ldots, i$$$} and arrange them in a circle$$$^\\dagger$$$. Find the value of $$$$$$ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^i \\left( C(i,j) \\bmod j \\right). $$$$$$ Here, the operation $$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$. Since this value can be very large, find it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$ In a circular arrangement, sequences are considered identical if one can be rotated to match the other. For instance, $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ and $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$ are equivalent in a circle.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the value of the expression to be calculated modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
