  "statement": "Suppose you have an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. Let $$$\\operatorname{lsl}(i)$$$ be the number of indices $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j < i$$$) such that $$$a_j < a_i$$$. Analogically, let $$$\\operatorname{grr}(i)$$$ be the number of indices $$$j$$$ ($$$i < j \\le n$$$) such that $$$a_j > a_i$$$. Let's name position $$$i$$$ good in the array $$$a$$$ if $$$\\operatorname{lsl}(i) < \\operatorname{grr}(i)$$$. Finally, let's define a function $$$f$$$ on array $$$a$$$ $$$f(a)$$$ as the sum of all $$$a_i$$$ such that $$$i$$$ is good in $$$a$$$. Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, find the sum of $$$f(a)$$$ over all arrays $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq k$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first and only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$; $$$2 \\leq k < 998\\,244\\,353$$$).",
