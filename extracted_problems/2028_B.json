  "statement": "Alice mixed up the words transmutation and permutation! She has an array $$$a$$$ specified via three integers $$$n$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$: the array $$$a$$$ has length $$$n$$$ and is given via $$$a_i = b\\cdot (i - 1) + c$$$ for $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$. For example, if $$$n=3$$$, $$$b=2$$$, and $$$c=1$$$, then $$$a=[2 \\cdot 0 + 1, 2 \\cdot 1 + 1, 2 \\cdot 2 + 1] = [1, 3, 5]$$$. Now, Alice really enjoys permutations of $$$[0, \\ldots, n-1]$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ and would like to transform $$$a$$$ into a permutation. In one operation, Alice replaces the maximum element of $$$a$$$ with the $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ of $$$a$$$. If there are multiple maximum elements in $$$a$$$, Alice chooses the leftmost one to replace. Can you help Alice figure out how many operations she has to do for $$$a$$$ to become a permutation for the first time? If it is impossible, you should report it. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ in arbitrary order. Please note, this is slightly different from the usual definition of a permutation. For example, $$$[1,2,0,4,3]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[0,1,1]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$1$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[0,2,3]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$3$$$ in the array). $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$The $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For example, the $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of $$$[0, 3, 1, 3]$$$ is $$$2$$$ and the $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of $$$[5]$$$ is $$$0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 10^{18}$$$; $$$0\\le b$$$, $$$c\\le 10^{18}$$$) — the parameters of the array.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if the array can never become a permutation, output $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output the minimum number of operations for the array to become a permutation.",
