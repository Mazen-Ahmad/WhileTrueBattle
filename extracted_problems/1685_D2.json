  "statement": "This is a hard version of the problem. The difference between the easy and hard versions is that in this version, you have to output the lexicographically smallest permutation with the smallest weight . You are given a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Let's define the weight of the permutation $$$q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ as $$$$$$|q_1 - p_{q_{2}}| + |q_2 - p_{q_{3}}| + \\ldots + |q_{n-1} - p_{q_{n}}| + |q_n - p_{q_{1}}|$$$$$$ You want your permutation to be as lightweight as possible. Among the permutations $$$q$$$ with the smallest possible weight, find the lexicographically smallest. Permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is lexicographically smaller than permutation $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$, if there exists some $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ such that $$$a_j = b_j$$$ for all $$$1 \\le j < i$$$ and $$$a_i<b_i$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 200$$$) — the size of the permutation. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) — the elements of the permutation. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$400$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le q_i \\le n$$$, all $$$q_i$$$ are distinct) — the lexicographically smallest permutation with the smallest weight.",
