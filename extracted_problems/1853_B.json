  "statement": "Ntarsis has received two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ for his birthday. He wonders how many fibonacci-like sequences of length $$$k$$$ can be formed with $$$n$$$ as the $$$k$$$-th element of the sequence. A sequence of non-decreasing non-negative integers is considered fibonacci-like if $$$f_i = f_{i-1} + f_{i-2}$$$ for all $$$i > 2$$$, where $$$f_i$$$ denotes the $$$i$$$-th element in the sequence. Note that $$$f_1$$$ and $$$f_2$$$ can be arbitrary. For example, sequences such as $$$[4,5,9,14]$$$ and $$$[0,1,1]$$$ are considered fibonacci-like sequences, while $$$[0,0,0,1,1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 1, 3]$$$, and $$$[-1,-1,-2]$$$ are not: the first two do not always satisfy $$$f_i = f_{i-1} + f_{i-2}$$$, the latter does not satisfy that the elements are non-negative. Impress Ntarsis by helping him with this task.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows. Each test case contains two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$3 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output an integer, the number of fibonacci-like sequences of length $$$k$$$ such that the $$$k$$$-th element in the sequence is $$$n$$$. That is, output the number of sequences $$$f$$$ of length $$$k$$$ so $$$f$$$ is a fibonacci-like sequence and $$$f_k = n$$$. It can be shown this number is finite.",
