  "statement": "Baby Ehab has a piece of Cut and Stick with an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ written on it. He plans to grab a pair of scissors and do the following to it: pick a range $$$(l, r)$$$ and cut out every element $$$a_l$$$, $$$a_{l + 1}$$$, ..., $$$a_r$$$ in this range; stick some of the elements together in the same order they were in the array; end up with multiple pieces, where every piece contains some of the elements and every element belongs to some piece. More formally, he partitions the sequence $$$a_l$$$, $$$a_{l + 1}$$$, ..., $$$a_r$$$ into subsequences. He thinks a partitioning is beautiful if for every piece (subsequence) it holds that, if it has length $$$x$$$, then no value occurs strictly more than $$$\\lceil \\frac{x}{2} \\rceil$$$ times in it. He didn't pick a range yet, so he's wondering: for $$$q$$$ ranges $$$(l, r)$$$, what is the minimum number of pieces he needs to partition the elements $$$a_l$$$, $$$a_{l + 1}$$$, ..., $$$a_r$$$ into so that the partitioning is beautiful. A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by deleting some (possibly zero) elements. Note that it does not have to be contiguous.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n,q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) — the range of this query.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print the minimum number of subsequences you need to partition this range into so that the partitioning is beautiful. We can prove such partitioning always exists.",
