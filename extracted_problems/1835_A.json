  "statement": "Consider all equalities of form $$$a + b = c$$$, where $$$a$$$ has $$$A$$$ digits, $$$b$$$ has $$$B$$$ digits, and $$$c$$$ has $$$C$$$ digits. All the numbers are positive integers and are written without leading zeroes. Find the $$$k$$$-th lexicographically smallest equality when written as a string like above or determine that it does not exist. For example, the first three equalities satisfying $$$A = 1$$$, $$$B = 1$$$, $$$C = 2$$$ are $$$1 + 9 = 10$$$, $$$2 + 8 = 10$$$, $$$2 + 9 = 11$$$. An equality $$$s$$$ is lexicographically smaller than an equality $$$t$$$ with the same lengths of the numbers if and only if the following holds: in the first position where $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ differ, the equality $$$s$$$ has a smaller digit than the corresponding digit in $$$t$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains integers $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A, B, C \\leq 6$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^{12}$$$). Each input file has at most $$$5$$$ test cases which do not satisfy $$$A, B, C \\leq 3$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there are strictly less than $$$k$$$ valid equalities, output $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output the $$$k$$$-th equality as a string of form $$$a + b = c$$$.",
