  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_n$$$ of pairwise distinct integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$. Consider the following operation: consecutively for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in this order, replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$$$. Here $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of a collection of integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_m$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$c$$$. For example, $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(0, 2, 2, 1, 4) = 3$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(1, 2) = 0$$$. Print the array after applying $$$k$$$ such operations.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 10^5$$$, $$$1\\le k\\le 10^9$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\\le a_i\\le n$$$) representing the elements of the array before applying the operations. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print all $$$n$$$ elements of the array after applying $$$k$$$ operations.",
