  "statement": "Chiyuu has a bracket sequence$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Let $$$k$$$ be the minimum number of characters that Chiyuu has to remove from $$$s$$$ to make $$$s$$$ balanced$$$^\\ddagger$$$. Now, Koxia wants you to count the number of ways to remove $$$k$$$ characters from $$$s$$$ so that $$$s$$$ becomes balanced, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Note that two ways of removing characters are considered distinct if and only if the set of indices removed is different. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A bracket sequence is a string containing only the characters \" ( \" and \" ) \". $$$^\\ddagger$$$ A bracket sequence is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters + and 1 . For example, sequences (())() , () , (()(())) and the empty string are balanced, while )( , (() , and (()))( are not.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq |s| \\leq 5 \\cdot {10}^5$$$) — the bracket sequence. It is guaranteed that $$$s$$$ only contains the characters \" ( \" and \" ) \".",
  "outputFormat": "Output a single integer — the number of ways to remove $$$k$$$ characters from $$$s$$$ so that $$$s$$$ becomes balanced, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
