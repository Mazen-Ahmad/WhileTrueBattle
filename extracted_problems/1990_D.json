  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. There is an $$$n \\times n$$$ grid. In the $$$i$$$-th row, the first $$$a_i$$$ cells are black and the other cells are white. In other words, note $$$(i,j)$$$ as the cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column, cells $$$(i,1), (i,2), \\ldots, (i,a_i)$$$ are black, and cells $$$(i,a_i+1), \\ldots, (i,n)$$$ are white. You can do the following operations any number of times in any order: Dye a $$$2 \\times 2$$$ subgrid white; Dye a whole row white. Note you can not dye a whole column white. Find the minimum number of operations to dye all cells white.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. For each test case: The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$). It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations to dye all cells white.",
