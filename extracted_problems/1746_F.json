  "statement": "You have an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers and you have to handle $$$q$$$ queries of the following types: $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$x$$$: change $$$a_{i}$$$ to $$$x$$$, $$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ $$$k$$$: check if the number of occurrences of every positive integer in the subarray $$$a_{l}, a_{l+1}, \\ldots a_{r}$$$ is a multiple of $$$k$$$ (check the example for better understanding).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n , q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$), the length of $$$a$$$ and the number of queries. Next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{i} \\le 10^9$$$) â€” the elements of $$$a$$$. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines describes a query. It has one of the following forms. $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$x$$$, ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ , $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$), or $$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ $$$k$$$, ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$ , $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each query of the second type, if answer of the query is yes, print \" YES \", otherwise print \" NO \".",
