  "statement": "You are given a sequence $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th element of the sequence is equal to $$$a_i$$$. You are also given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x \\le y$$$). A pair of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ is considered interesting if the following conditions are met: $$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$; if you simultaneously remove the elements at positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ from the sequence $$$a$$$, the sum of the remaining elements is at least $$$x$$$ and at most $$$y$$$. Your task is to determine the number of interesting pairs of integers for the given sequence $$$a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: The first line contains three integers $$$n, x, y$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le x \\le y \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{14}$$$); The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{9}$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the number of interesting pairs of integers for the given sequence $$$a$$$.",
