  "statement": "Suppose you have an integer $$$v$$$. In one operation, you can: either set $$$v = (v + 1) \\bmod 32768$$$ or set $$$v = (2 \\cdot v) \\bmod 32768$$$. You are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. What is the minimum number of operations you need to make each $$$a_i$$$ equal to $$$0$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 32768$$$) â€” the number of integers. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < 32768$$$).",
