  "statement": "Freya the Frog is traveling on the 2D coordinate plane. She is currently at point $$$(0,0)$$$ and wants to go to point $$$(x,y)$$$. In one move, she chooses an integer $$$d$$$ such that $$$0 \\leq d \\leq k$$$ and jumps $$$d$$$ spots forward in the direction she is facing. Initially, she is facing the positive $$$x$$$ direction. After every move, she will alternate between facing the positive $$$x$$$ direction and the positive $$$y$$$ direction (i.e., she will face the positive $$$y$$$ direction on her second move, the positive $$$x$$$ direction on her third move, and so on). What is the minimum amount of moves she must perform to land on point $$$(x,y)$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\leq x, y \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the number of jumps Freya needs to make on a new line.",
