  "statement": "A subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A palindromic sequence is a sequence that is equal to the reverse of itself. You are given a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. Any integer value appears in $$$a$$$ no more than twice . What is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of sequence $$$a$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases. Then the descriptions of $$$t$$$ testcases follow. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 250\\,000$$$) — the number of elements in the sequence. The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). Any integer value appears in $$$a$$$ no more than twice. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$250\\,000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase print a single integer — the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of sequence $$$a$$$.",
