  "statement": "Vladislav has $$$n$$$ cards numbered $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$. He wants to lay them down in a row as follows: First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. $$$2$$$ multiplied by an odd number). Next, he lays down all cards that are $$$3$$$ times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. $$$3$$$ multiplied by an odd number). Next, he lays down all cards that are $$$4$$$ times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. $$$4$$$ multiplied by an odd number). And so on, until all cards are laid down. What is the $$$k$$$-th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a card down, he cannot use that card again.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you need to output.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the $$$k$$$-th card Vladislav lays down.",
