  "statement": "William is not only interested in trading but also in betting on sports matches. $$$n$$$ teams participate in each match. Each team is characterized by strength $$$a_i$$$. Each two teams $$$i < j$$$ play with each other exactly once. Team $$$i$$$ wins with probability $$$\\frac{a_i}{a_i + a_j}$$$ and team $$$j$$$ wins with probability $$$\\frac{a_j}{a_i + a_j}$$$. The team is called a winner if it directly or indirectly defeated all other teams. Team $$$a$$$ defeated (directly or indirectly) team $$$b$$$ if there is a sequence of teams $$$c_1$$$, $$$c_2$$$, ... $$$c_k$$$ such that $$$c_1 = a$$$, $$$c_k = b$$$ and team $$$c_i$$$ defeated team $$$c_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k - 1$$$. Note that it is possible that team $$$a$$$ defeated team $$$b$$$ and in the same time team $$$b$$$ defeated team $$$a$$$. William wants you to find the expected value of the number of winners.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 14$$$), which is the total number of teams participating in a match. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^6$$$) — the strengths of teams participating in a match.",
  "outputFormat": "Output a single integer — the expected value of the number of winners of the tournament modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. Formally, let $$$M = 10^9+7$$$. It can be demonstrated that the answer can be presented as a irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output a single integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.",
