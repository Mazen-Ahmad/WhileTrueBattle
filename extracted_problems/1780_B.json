  "statement": "While at Kira's house, Josuke saw a piece of paper on the table with a task written on it. The task sounded as follows. There is an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. On this array, do the following: select an integer $$$k > 1$$$; split the array into $$$k$$$ subsegments $$$^\\dagger$$$; calculate the sum in each of $$$k$$$ subsegments and write these sums to another array $$$b$$$ (where the sum of the subsegment $$$(l, r)$$$ is $$${\\sum_{j = l}^{r}a_j}$$$); the final score of such a split will be $$$\\gcd(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_k)^\\ddagger$$$. The task is to find such a partition that the score is maximum possible . Josuke is interested in this task but is not strong in computer science. Help him to find the maximum possible score. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A division of an array into $$$k$$$ subsegments is $$$k$$$ pairs of numbers $$$(l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), \\ldots, (l_k, r_k)$$$ such that $$$l_i \\le r_i$$$ and for every $$$1 \\le j \\le k - 1$$$ $$$l_{j + 1} = r_j + 1$$$, also $$$l_1 = 1$$$ and $$$r_k = n$$$. These pairs represent the subsegments. $$$^\\ddagger$$$ $$$\\gcd(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_k)$$$ stands for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the array $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9 $$$) — the array $$$a$$$ itself. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
