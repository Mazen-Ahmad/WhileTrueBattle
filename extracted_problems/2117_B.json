  "statement": "A shrink operation on an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$m$$$ is defined as follows: Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$2 \\le i \\le m - 1$$$) such that $$$a_i \\gt a_{i - 1}$$$ and $$$a_i \\gt a_{i + 1}$$$. Remove $$$a_i$$$ from the array. Define the score of a permutation$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ as the maximum number of times that you can perform the shrink operation on $$$p$$$. Yousef has given you a single integer $$$n$$$. Construct a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ with the maximum possible score . If there are multiple answers, you can output any of them. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output any permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$ that maximizes the number of shrink operations.",
