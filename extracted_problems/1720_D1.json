  "statement": "It is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$a_i \\le 200$$$. You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_{n - 1}$$$. Bryap wants to find the longest beautiful subsequence in the array. An array $$$b = [b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_{m-1}]$$$, where $$$0 \\le b_0 < b_1 < \\ldots < b_{m - 1} < n$$$, is a subsequence of length $$$m$$$ of the array $$$a$$$. Subsequence $$$b = [b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_{m-1}]$$$ of length $$$m$$$ is called beautiful , if the following condition holds: For any $$$p$$$ ($$$0 \\le p < m - 1$$$) holds: $$$a_{b_p} \\oplus b_{p+1} < a_{b_{p+1}} \\oplus b_p$$$. Here $$$a \\oplus b$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. For example, $$$2 \\oplus 4 = 6$$$ and $$$3 \\oplus 1=2$$$. Bryap is a simple person so he only wants to know the length of the longest such subsequence. Help Bryap and find the answer to his question.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_0,a_1,...,a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 200$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
