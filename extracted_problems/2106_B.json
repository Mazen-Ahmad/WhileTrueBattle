  "statement": "Given a permutation$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that contains every integer from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ and a strip of $$$n$$$ cells, St. Chroma will paint the $$$i$$$-th cell of the strip in the color $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i)$$$$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$. For example, suppose $$$p = [1, 0, 3, 2]$$$. Then, St. Chroma will paint the cells of the strip in the following way: $$$[0, 2, 2, 4]$$$. You have been given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$. Because St. Chroma loves color $$$x$$$, construct a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the number of cells in the strip that are painted color $$$x$$$ is maximized . $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ elements that contains every integer from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ exactly once. For example, $$$[0, 3, 1, 2]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1, 2, 0, 1]$$$ isn't since $$$1$$$ appears twice, and $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$ isn't since $$$0$$$ does not appear at all. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$The $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of a sequence is defined as the first non-negative integer that does not appear in it. For example, $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(1, 3, 0, 2) = 4$$$, and $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(3, 1, 2) = 0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 4000$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le x \\le n$$$) — the number of cells and the color you want to maximize. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Output a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that the number of cells in the strip that are painted color $$$x$$$ is maximized . If there exist multiple such permutations, output any of them.",
