  "statement": "In Berland, there are two types of coins, having denominations of $$$2$$$ and $$$k$$$ burles. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to represent $$$n$$$ burles in coins, i. e. whether there exist non-negative integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$2 \\cdot x + k \\cdot y = n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$; $$$k \\ne 2$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if it is possible to represent $$$n$$$ burles in coins; otherwise, print NO . You may print each letter in any case ( YES , yes , Yes will all be recognized as positive answer, NO , no and nO will all be recognized as negative answer).",
