  "statement": "There is a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. In one operation, you can select any prefix of $$$a$$$ with an equal number of $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ symbols. Then all symbols in the prefix are inverted: each $$$0$$$ becomes $$$1$$$ and each $$$1$$$ becomes $$$0$$$. For example, suppose $$$a=0111010000$$$. In the first operation, we can select the prefix of length $$$8$$$ since it has four $$$0$$$'s and four $$$1$$$'s: $$$[01110100]00\\to [10001011]00$$$. In the second operation, we can select the prefix of length $$$2$$$ since it has one $$$0$$$ and one $$$1$$$: $$$[10]00101100\\to [01]00101100$$$. It is illegal to select the prefix of length $$$4$$$ for the third operation, because it has three $$$0$$$'s and one $$$1$$$. Can you transform the string $$$a$$$ into the string $$$b$$$ using some finite number of operations (possibly, none)?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 3\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The following two lines contain strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of symbols $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. The sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$3\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" YES \" if it is possible to transform $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$, or \" NO \" if it is impossible. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).",
