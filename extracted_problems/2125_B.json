  "statement": "There is a robot located in the cell $$$(a,b)$$$ of an infinite grid. Misha wants to move it to the cell $$$(0,0)$$$. To do this, he has fixed some integer $$$k$$$. Misha can perform the following operation: choose two integers $$$dx$$$ and $$$dy$$$ (both from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$ inclusive) and move the robot $$$dx$$$ cells to the left (in the direction of decreasing $$$x$$$ coordinate) and $$$dy$$$ cells down (in the direction of decreasing $$$y$$$ coordinate). In other words, move the robot from $$$(x,y)$$$ to $$$(x - dx, y - dy)$$$. The cost of the operation is: $$$1$$$, if the chosen pair $$$(dx,dy)$$$ is used for the first time; $$$0$$$, if the pair $$$(dx,dy)$$$ has been chosen before. Note that if $$$dx \\ne dy$$$, the pairs $$$(dx, dy)$$$ and $$$(dy, dx)$$$ are considered different. Help Misha bring the robot to the cell $$$(0,0)$$$ with minimum total cost. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$a, b$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b, k \\le 10^{18}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum total cost of operations required to move the robot to the cell $$$(0,0)$$$.",
