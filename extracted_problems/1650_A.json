  "statement": "The string $$$s$$$ is given, the string length is odd number. The string consists of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. As long as the string length is greater than $$$1$$$, the following operation can be performed on it: select any two adjacent letters in the string $$$s$$$ and delete them from the string. For example, from the string \" lemma \" in one operation, you can get any of the four strings: \" mma \", \" lma \", \" lea \" or \" lem \" In particular, in one operation, the length of the string reduces by $$$2$$$. Formally, let the string $$$s$$$ have the form $$$s=s_1s_2 \\dots s_n$$$ ($$$n>1$$$). During one operation, you choose an arbitrary index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < n$$$) and replace $$$s=s_1s_2 \\dots s_{i-1}s_{i+2} \\dots s_n$$$. For the given string $$$s$$$ and the letter $$$c$$$, determine whether it is possible to make such a sequence of operations that in the end the equality $$$s=c$$$ will be true? In other words, is there such a sequence of operations that the process will end with a string of length $$$1$$$, which consists of the letter $$$c$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) â€” the number of input test cases. The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ cases follow. Each test case is represented by two lines: string $$$s$$$, which has an odd length from $$$1$$$ to $$$49$$$ inclusive and consists of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet; is a string containing one letter $$$c$$$, where $$$c$$$ is a lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case in a separate line output: YES , if the string $$$s$$$ can be converted so that $$$s=c$$$ is true; NO otherwise. You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, the strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).",
