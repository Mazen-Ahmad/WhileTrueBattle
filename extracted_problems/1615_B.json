  "statement": "You are given an array consisting of all integers from $$$[l, r]$$$ inclusive. For example, if $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 5$$$, the array would be $$$[2, 3, 4, 5]$$$. What's the minimum number of elements you can delete to make the bitwise AND of the array non-zero? A bitwise AND is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the description of the array.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the answer to the problem.",
