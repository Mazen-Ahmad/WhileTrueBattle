  "statement": "Yet another random problem. Tenzing has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$v$$$. Tenzing will perform the following operation $$$m$$$ times: Choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ uniformly at random. For all $$$j$$$ such that $$$i \\leq j \\leq n$$$, set $$$a_j := a_j + v$$$. Tenzing wants to know the expected value of $$$\\prod_{i=1}^n a_i$$$ after performing the $$$m$$$ operations, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. Formally, let $$$M = 10^9+7$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output the integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 5000$$$, $$$1\\leq m,v\\leq 10^9$$$). The second line of input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 10^9$$$).",
