  "statement": "Note the unusual definition of $$$\\text{MEX}$$$ in this problem. Piggy gave Turtle a binary tree $$$^{\\dagger}$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices and a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ on his birthday. The binary tree is rooted at vertex $$$1$$$. If a set of paths $$$P = \\{(x_i, y_i)\\}$$$ in the tree covers each edge exactly once , then Turtle will think that the set of paths is good . Note that a good set of paths can cover a vertex twice or more. Turtle defines the value of a set of paths as $$$\\sum\\limits_{(x, y) \\in P} f(x, y)$$$, where $$$f(x, y)$$$ denotes the $$$\\text{MEX}^{\\ddagger}$$$ of all $$$a_u$$$ such that vertex $$$u$$$ is on the simple path from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$ in the tree (including the starting vertex $$$x$$$ and the ending vertex $$$y$$$). Turtle wonders the minimum value over all good sets of paths. Please help him calculate the answer! $$$^{\\dagger}$$$A binary tree is a tree where every non-leaf vertex has at most $$$2$$$ sons. $$$^{\\ddagger}\\text{MEX}$$$ of a collection of integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$$$ is defined as the smallest positive integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$c$$$. For example, $$$\\text{MEX}$$$ of $$$[3, 3, 1, 4]$$$ is $$$2$$$, $$$\\text{MEX}$$$ of $$$[2, 3]$$$ is $$$1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2.5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i < i$$$) — the parent of each vertex in the tree. Additional constraint on the input: the given tree is a binary tree, that is, every non-leaf vertex has at most $$$2$$$ sons. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
