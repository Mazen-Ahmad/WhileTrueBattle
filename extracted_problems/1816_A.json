  "statement": "Ian and Mary are frogs living on lattice points of the Cartesian coordinate plane, with Ian living on $$$(0,0)$$$ and Mary living on $$$(a,b)$$$. Ian would like to visit Mary by jumping around the Cartesian coordinate plane. Every second, he jumps from his current position $$$(x_p, y_p)$$$ to another lattice point $$$(x_q, y_q)$$$, such that no lattice point other than $$$(x_p, y_p)$$$ and $$$(x_q, y_q)$$$ lies on the segment between point $$$(x_p, y_p)$$$ and point $$$(x_q, y_q)$$$. As Ian wants to meet Mary as soon as possible, he wants to jump towards point $$$(a,b)$$$ using at most $$$2$$$ jumps . Unfortunately, Ian is not good at maths. Can you help him? A lattice point is defined as a point with both the $$$x$$$-coordinate and $$$y$$$-coordinate being integers.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1\\le a,b\\le 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the lattice point where Mary lives.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2$$$) on the first line, denoting the number of jumps Ian uses in order to meet Mary. Note that you do not need to minimize the number of jumps. On the $$$i$$$-th line of the next $$$n$$$ lines, print two integers $$$0 \\le x_i,y_i \\le 10^9$$$ separated by a space, denoting Ian's location $$$(x_i,y_i)$$$ after the $$$i$$$-th jump. $$$x_n = a$$$, $$$y_n = b$$$ must hold. Ian's initial location and his locations after each of the $$$n$$$ jumps need not be distinct. If there are multiple solutions, output any.",
