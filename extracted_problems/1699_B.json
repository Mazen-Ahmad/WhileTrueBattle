  "statement": "You are given two even integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. Your task is to find any binary matrix $$$a$$$ with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns where every cell $$$(i,j)$$$ has exactly two neighbours with a different value than $$$a_{i,j}$$$. Two cells in the matrix are considered neighbours if and only if they share a side. More formally, the neighbours of cell $$$(x,y)$$$ are: $$$(x-1,y)$$$, $$$(x,y+1)$$$, $$$(x+1,y)$$$ and $$$(x,y-1)$$$. It can be proven that under the given constraints, an answer always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. The only line of each test case contains two even integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n,m \\le 50$$$) — the height and width of the binary matrix, respectively.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$n$$$ lines, each of which contains $$$m$$$ numbers, equal to $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ — any binary matrix which satisfies the constraints described in the statement. It can be proven that under the given constraints, an answer always exists.",
