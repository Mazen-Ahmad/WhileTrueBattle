  "statement": "You have $$$n$$$ rectangular wooden blocks, which are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th block is $$$1$$$ unit high and $$$\\lceil \\frac{i}{2} \\rceil$$$ units long. Here, $$$\\lceil \\frac{x}{2} \\rceil$$$ denotes the result of division of $$$x$$$ by $$$2$$$, rounded up . For example, $$$\\lceil \\frac{4}{2} \\rceil = 2$$$ and $$$\\lceil \\frac{5}{2} \\rceil = \\lceil 2.5 \\rceil = 3$$$. For example, if $$$n=5$$$, then the blocks have the following sizes: $$$1 \\times 1$$$, $$$1 \\times 1$$$, $$$1 \\times 2$$$, $$$1 \\times 2$$$, $$$1 \\times 3$$$. The available blocks for $$$n=5$$$ Find the maximum possible side length of a square you can create using these blocks, without rotating any of them . Note that you don't have to use all of the blocks. One of the ways to create $$$3 \\times 3$$$ square using blocks $$$1$$$ through $$$5$$$",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of blocks.",
