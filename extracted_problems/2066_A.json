  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. You are given an array $$$x_1, \\ldots, x_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The jury also has a fixed but hidden array $$$y_1, \\ldots, y_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The elements of array $$$y$$$ are unknown to you. Additionally, it is known that for all $$$i$$$, $$$x_i \\neq y_i$$$, and all pairs $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ are distinct. The jury has secretly thought of one of two objects, and you need to determine which one it is: Object A : A directed graph with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and with $$$n$$$ edges of the form $$$x_i \\to y_i$$$. Object B : $$$n$$$ points on a coordinate plane. The $$$i$$$-th point has coordinates $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. To guess which object the jury has thought of, you can make queries. In one query, you must specify two numbers $$$i, j$$$ $$$(1 \\leq i, j \\leq n, i \\neq j)$$$. In response, you receive one number: If the jury has thought of Object A , you receive the length of the shortest path (in edges) from vertex $$$i$$$ to vertex $$$j$$$ in the graph, or $$$0$$$ if there is no path. If the jury has thought of Object B , you receive the Manhattan distance between points $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, that is $$$|x_i -x_j| + |y_i - y_j|$$$. You have $$$2$$$ queries to determine which of the objects the jury has thought of.",
