  "statement": "I shall be looking for you who would be out of Existence. — HyuN, Disorder There are always many repetitive tasks in life. Iris always dislikes them, so she refuses to repeat them. However, time cannot be turned back; we only have to move forward. Formally, Iris has an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, where each number in the sequence is between $$$1$$$ and $$$w$$$, inclusive. It is guaranteed that $$$w \\geq 2$$$. Iris defines an operation as selecting two numbers $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ satisfying $$$a_i = a_{i+1}$$$, and then changing them to two arbitrary integers within the range $$$[1, w]$$$. Iris does not like equality, so she must guarantee that $$$a_i \\neq a_{i+1}$$$ after the operation. Two identical pairs $$$a_i, a_{i+1}$$$ can be selected multiple times. Iris wants to know the maximum possible sum of all elements of $$$a$$$ after several (possible, zero) operations , as well as the minimum number of operations required to achieve this maximum value.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\leq w \\leq 10^8$$$) — the length of the array, and the maximum allowed value of the elements. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq w$$$) — the elements in the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output two integers — the maximum possible sum of all elements of $$$a$$$ and the minimum number of operations required, respectively.",
