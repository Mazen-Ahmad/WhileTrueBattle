  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers and an integer $$$x$$$. You can do the following two-step operation any (possibly zero) number of times: Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$). Increase $$$a_i$$$ by $$$x$$$, in other words $$$a_i := a_i + x$$$. Find the maximum value of the $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of $$$a$$$ if you perform the operations optimally. The $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ (minimum excluded value) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array. For example: The $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of $$$[2,2,1]$$$ is $$$0$$$ because $$$0$$$ is not in the array. The $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of $$$[3,1,0,1]$$$ is $$$2$$$ because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ are in the array but $$$2$$$ is not. The $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of $$$[0,3,1,2]$$$ is $$$4$$$ because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ are in the array but $$$4$$$ is not.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the integer to be used in the operation. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the given array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of $$$a$$$ if you perform the operations optimally.",
