  "statement": "AquaMoon has a string $$$a$$$ consisting of only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. She wants to add $$$+$$$ and $$$-$$$ between all pairs of consecutive positions to make the absolute value of the resulting expression as small as possible. Can you help her?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2\\,000$$$) – the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a string of length $$$n - 1$$$ consisting of $$$-$$$ and $$$+$$$ on a separate line. If there is more than one assignment of signs that produces the smallest possible absolute value, any of them is accepted.",
