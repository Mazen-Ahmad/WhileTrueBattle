  "statement": "Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour format. 24-hour format divides the day into 24 hours from $$$00$$$ to $$$23$$$, each of which has 60 minutes from $$$00$$$ to $$$59$$$. 12-hour format divides the day into two halves: the first half is $$$\\mathrm{AM}$$$, and the second half is $$$\\mathrm{PM}$$$. In each half, the hours are numbered in the order $$$12, 01, 02, 03, \\dots, 11$$$. Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from $$$00$$$ to $$$59$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1440$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$5$$$ with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour from $$$00$$$ to $$$23$$$, and mm represents the minute from $$$00$$$ to $$$59$$$. The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output two strings separated by a space (\" hh:mm AM \" or \" hh:mm PM \"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test case (without quotes). You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not remove leading zeroes.",
