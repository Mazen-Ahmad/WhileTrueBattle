  "statement": "For a multiset $$$T$$$ consisting of non-negative integers, we define: $$$\\text{sum}(T)$$$ is the sum of all elements in $$$T$$$. For example, if $$$T = \\{0,1, 1, 3\\}$$$, then $$$\\text{sum}(T)= 0+1+1+3=5$$$. $$$\\text{mex}(T)$$$ is the smallest non-negative integer not in $$$T$$$. For example, if $$$T = \\{0,1, 1, 3\\}$$$, then $$$\\text{mex}(T) = 2$$$ because $$$2$$$ is the smallest non-negative integer not present in $$$T$$$. You are given a multiset $$$S$$$ of size $$$n$$$ consisting of non-negative integers. At first, your score is $$$0$$$. You can perform the following operations any number of times in any order (possibly zero): Select a subset $$$S' \\subseteq S$$$ (i.e., $$$S'$$$ contains some of the elements currently in $$$S$$$), add $$$\\text{sum}(S')$$$ to your score, and then remove $$$S'$$$ from $$$S$$$. Select a subset $$$S' \\subseteq S$$$, add $$$\\text{mex}(S')$$$ to your score, and then remove $$$S'$$$ from $$$S$$$. Find the maximum possible score that can be obtained.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le S_i \\le 50$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer â€” the maximum possible score that can be obtained.",
