  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Let $$$cnt_x$$$ be the number of elements from the array which are equal to $$$x$$$. Let's also define $$$f(x, y)$$$ as $$$(cnt_x + cnt_y) \\cdot (x + y)$$$. Also you are given $$$m$$$ bad pairs $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. Note that if $$$(x, y)$$$ is a bad pair, then $$$(y, x)$$$ is also bad. Your task is to find the maximum value of $$$f(u, v)$$$ over all pairs $$$(u, v)$$$, such that $$$u \\neq v$$$, that this pair is not bad, and also that $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ each occur in the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that such a pair exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array and the number of bad pairs. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i < y_i \\le 10^9$$$), which represent a bad pair. It is guaranteed that no bad pair occurs twice in the input. It is also guaranteed that $$$cnt_{x_i} > 0$$$ and $$$cnt_{y_i} > 0$$$. It is guaranteed that for each test case there is a pair of integers $$$(u, v)$$$, $$$u \\ne v$$$, that is not bad, and such that both of these numbers occur in $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ and the total sum of $$$m$$$ don't exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
