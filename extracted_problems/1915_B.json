  "statement": "A Latin square is a $$$3 \\times 3$$$ grid made up of the letters $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{C}$$$ such that: in each row, the letters $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{C}$$$ each appear once, and in each column, the letters $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{C}$$$ each appear once. For example, one possible Latin square is shown below. $$$$$$\\begin{bmatrix} \\texttt{A} & \\texttt{B} & \\texttt{C} \\\\ \\texttt{C} & \\texttt{A} & \\texttt{B} \\\\ \\texttt{B} & \\texttt{C} & \\texttt{A} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$$$$$$ You are given a Latin square, but one of the letters was replaced with a question mark $$$\\texttt{?}$$$. Find the letter that was replaced.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 108$$$) â€” the number of testcases. Each test case contains three lines, each consisting of three characters, representing the Latin square. Each character is one of $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$\\texttt{C}$$$, or $$$\\texttt{?}$$$. Each test case is a Latin square with exactly one of the letters replaced with a question mark $$$\\texttt{?}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the letter that was replaced.",
