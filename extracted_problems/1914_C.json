  "statement": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. In order to level up his character, he can complete quests. There are $$$n$$$ quests in the game, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Monocarp can complete quests according to the following rules: the $$$1$$$-st quest is always available for completion; the $$$i$$$-th quest is available for completion if all quests $$$j < i$$$ have been completed at least once. Note that Monocarp can complete the same quest multiple times. For each completion, the character gets some amount of experience points: for the first completion of the $$$i$$$-th quest, he gets $$$a_i$$$ experience points; for each subsequent completion of the $$$i$$$-th quest, he gets $$$b_i$$$ experience points. Monocarp is a very busy person, so he has free time to complete no more than $$$k$$$ quests. Your task is to calculate the maximum possible total experience Monocarp can get if he can complete no more than $$$k$$$ quests.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of quests and the maximum number of quests Monocarp can complete, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^3$$$). The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^3$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible total experience Monocarp can get if he can complete no more than $$$k$$$ quests.",
