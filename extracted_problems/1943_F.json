  "statement": "You are given a binary string$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. A binary string $$$p$$$ of the same length $$$n$$$ is called good if for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$), there exist indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that: $$$1 \\leq l \\leq i \\leq r \\leq n$$$ $$$s_i$$$ is a mode$$$^\\ddagger$$$ of the string $$$p_lp_{l+1}\\ldots p_r$$$ You are given another binary string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Find the minimum Hamming distance$$$^\\S$$$ between $$$t$$$ and any good string $$$g$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A binary string is a string that only consists of characters $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$. $$$^\\ddagger$$$ Character $$$c$$$ is a mode of string $$$p$$$ of length $$$m$$$ if the number of occurrences of $$$c$$$ in $$$p$$$ is at least $$$\\lceil \\frac{m}{2} \\rceil$$$. For example, $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ is a mode of $$$\\mathtt{010}$$$, $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ is not a mode of $$$\\mathtt{010}$$$, and both $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ are modes of $$$\\mathtt{011010}$$$. $$$^\\S$$$ The Hamming distance of strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ is the number of indices $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq i \\leq m$$$ and $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the length of the binary string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters 0 and 1 . The third line of each test case contains a binary string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters 0 and 1 . It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$, with the additional assurance that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^8$$$",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the minimum Hamming distance between $$$t$$$ and any good string $$$g$$$.",
