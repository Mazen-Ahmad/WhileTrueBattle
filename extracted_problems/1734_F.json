  "statement": "Let $$$S$$$ be the Thue-Morse sequence . In other words, $$$S$$$ is the $$$0$$$-indexed binary string with infinite length that can be constructed as follows: Initially, let $$$S$$$ be \" 0 \". Then, we perform the following operation infinitely many times: concatenate $$$S$$$ with a copy of itself with flipped bits. For example, here are the first four iterations: Iteration $$$S$$$ before iteration $$$S$$$ before iteration with flipped bits Concatenated $$$S$$$ 1 0 1 01 2 01 10 0110 3 0110 1001 01101001 4 01101001 10010110 0110100110010110 $$$\\ldots$$$ $$$\\ldots$$$ $$$\\ldots$$$ $$$\\ldots$$$ You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. Find the number of positions where the strings $$$S_0 S_1 \\ldots S_{m-1}$$$ and $$$S_n S_{n + 1} \\ldots S_{n + m - 1}$$$ are different.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains two positive integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ respectively ($$$1 \\leq n,m \\leq 10^{18}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, output a non-negative integer — the Hamming distance between the two required strings.",
