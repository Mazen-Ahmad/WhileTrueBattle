  "statement": "You are given an integer array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Initially, all elements of the array are colored red. You have to choose exactly $$$k$$$ elements of the array and paint them blue. Then, while there is at least one red element, you have to select any red element with a blue neighbor and make it blue. The cost of painting the array is defined as the sum of the first $$$k$$$ chosen elements and the last painted element. Your task is to calculate the maximum possible cost of painting for the given array.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5000$$$; $$$1 \\le k < n$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible cost of painting for the given array.",
