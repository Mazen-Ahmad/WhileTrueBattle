  "statement": "In the long-forgotten halls of Kombinatoria's ancient academy, a gifted mathematician named Kim is faced with an unusual challenge. They found an old sequence of integers, which is believed to be a cryptic message from the legendary Kombinatoria's Oracle, and Kim wants to decipher its hidden meaning. Kim's mission is to find specific patterns within the sequence, known as Harmonious Subsequences . These are extraordinary subsequences where the sum of every three consecutive numbers is even, and each subsequence must be at least three numbers in length. Given a sequence $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) of length $$$n$$$, its subsequence of length $$$m$$$ is equal to $$$a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \\ldots, a_{b_m}$$$ and is uniquely defined by a set of $$$m$$$ indices $$$b_j$$$, such that $$$1 \\le b_1 < b_2 < \\ldots < b_m \\le n$$$. Subsequences given by different sets of indices $$$b_j$$$ are considered different. There's a twist in Kim's quest: the number of these Harmonious Subsequences could be overwhelming. To report the findings effectively, Kim must calculate the total number of these subsequences, presenting the answer as a remainder after dividing by the number $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ — the length of the sequence ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ — the elements of the sequence ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Output one number — the number of Harmonious Subsequences, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
