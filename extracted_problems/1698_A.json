  "statement": "There is an array $$$a$$$ with $$$n-1$$$ integers. Let $$$x$$$ be the bitwise XOR of all elements of the array. The number $$$x$$$ is added to the end of the array $$$a$$$ (now it has length $$$n$$$), and then the elements are shuffled. You are given the newly formed array $$$a$$$. What is $$$x$$$? If there are multiple possible values of $$$x$$$, you can output any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the number of integers in the resulting array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 127$$$) — the elements of the newly formed array $$$a$$$. Additional constraint on the input: the array $$$a$$$ is made by the process described in the statement; that is, some value of $$$x$$$ exists.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the value of $$$x$$$, as described in the statement. If there are multiple possible values of $$$x$$$, output any of them.",
