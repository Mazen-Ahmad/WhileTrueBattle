  "statement": "Scientists are researching an impact of football match results on the mood of football fans. They have a hypothesis that there is a correlation between the number of draws and fans' desire to watch football matches in the future. In football, two teams play a match. The teams score goals throughout a match. A score \"$$$x$$$ : $$$y$$$\" means that the team we observe scored $$$x$$$ goals and conceded $$$y$$$ goals. If $$$x = y$$$, then the match ends in a draw. If $$$x > y$$$, then the observed team wins, and if $$$x < y$$$, then it loses. To find out if there is a correlation, the scientists gathered information about the results of teams in lower leagues. The information they found is the number of matches played by the team ($$$n$$$), the number of goals scored in these matches ($$$a$$$), and the number of goals conceded in these matches ($$$b$$$). You are given this information for a single team. You are asked to calculate the minimum number of draws that could have happened during the team's matches and provide a list of match scores with the minimum number of draws.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ — the number of matches played by the team ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$). The second line contains an integer $$$a$$$ — the total number of goals scored by the team in all $$$n$$$ matches ($$$0 \\le a \\le 1000$$$). The third line contains an integer $$$b$$$ — the total number of goals conceded by the team in all $$$n$$$ matches ($$$0 \\le b \\le 1000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "In the first line, print a single integer $$$d$$$ — the minimum number of draws. In the following $$$n$$$ lines, print a list of match scores, each line in the format \"$$$x$$$ : $$$y$$$\", where $$$x$$$ is the number of goals scored in the match, and $$$y$$$ – the number of goals conceded, so that exactly $$$d$$$ of these matches have ended in a draw. In case multiple such lists of match scores exist, print any of them.",
