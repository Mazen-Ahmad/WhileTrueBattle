  "statement": "CQXYM is counting permutations length of $$$2n$$$. A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). A permutation $$$p$$$(length of $$$2n$$$) will be counted only if the number of $$$i$$$ satisfying $$$p_i<p_{i+1}$$$ is no less than $$$n$$$. For example: Permutation $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ will count, because the number of such $$$i$$$ that $$$p_i<p_{i+1}$$$ equals $$$3$$$ ($$$i = 1$$$, $$$i = 2$$$, $$$i = 3$$$). Permutation $$$[3, 2, 1, 4]$$$ won't count, because the number of such $$$i$$$ that $$$p_i<p_{i+1}$$$ equals $$$1$$$ ($$$i = 3$$$). CQXYM wants you to help him to count the number of such permutations modulo $$$1000000007$$$ ($$$10^9+7$$$). In addition, modulo operation is to get the remainder. For example: $$$7 \\mod 3=1$$$, because $$$7 = 3 \\cdot 2 + 1$$$, $$$15 \\mod 4=3$$$, because $$$15 = 4 \\cdot 3 + 3$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t (t \\geq 1)$$$ â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. Only one line of each test case contains an integer $$$n(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer in a single line.",
