  "statement": "Given an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$). Find the maximum value of $$$i + j$$$ such that $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ are coprime,$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ or $$$-1$$$ if no such $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ exist. For example consider the array $$$[1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 7, 7]$$$. The maximum value of $$$i + j$$$ that can be obtained is $$$5 + 7$$$, since $$$a_5 = 4$$$ and $$$a_7 = 7$$$ are coprime. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$ Two integers $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are coprime if the only positive integer that is a divisor of both of them is $$$1$$$ (that is, their greatest common divisor is $$$1$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The following line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated positive integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$,..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 1000$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum value of $$$i + j$$$ such that $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ satisfy the condition that $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ are coprime, or output $$$-1$$$ in case no $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ satisfy the condition.",
