  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. For a binary$$$^\\dagger$$$ pattern $$$p$$$ and a binary string $$$q$$$, both of length $$$m$$$, $$$q$$$ is called $$$p$$$- good if for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq m$$$), there exist indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that: $$$1 \\leq l \\leq i \\leq r \\leq m$$$, and $$$p_i$$$ is a mode$$$^\\ddagger$$$ of the string $$$q_l q_{l+1} \\ldots q_{r}$$$. For a pattern $$$p$$$, let $$$f(p)$$$ be the minimum possible number of $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$s in a $$$p$$$-good binary string (of the same length as the pattern). You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Find $$$$$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=i}^{n} f(s_i s_{i+1} \\ldots s_j).$$$$$$ In other words, you need to sum the values of $$$f$$$ over all $$$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$$ substrings of $$$s$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A binary pattern is a string that only consists of characters $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$. $$$^\\ddagger$$$ Character $$$c$$$ is a mode of string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$ if the number of occurrences of $$$c$$$ in $$$t$$$ is at least $$$\\lceil \\frac{m}{2} \\rceil$$$. For example, $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ is a mode of $$$\\mathtt{010}$$$, $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ is not a mode of $$$\\mathtt{010}$$$, and both $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ are modes of $$$\\mathtt{011010}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$) — the length of the binary string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of only characters $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the sum of values of $$$f$$$ over all substrings of $$$s$$$.",
