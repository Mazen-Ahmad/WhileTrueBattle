  "statement": "We are sum for we are many Some Number This version of the problem differs from the next one only in the constraint on $$$t$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. You are given two positive integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. Count the number of distinct triplets of integers $$$(i, j, k)$$$ such that $$$l \\le i < j < k \\le r$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{lcm}(i,j,k) \\ge i + j + k$$$. Here $$$\\operatorname{lcm}(i, j, k)$$$ denotes the least common multiple (LCM) of integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, and $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$\\bf{1 \\le t \\le 5}$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The only line for each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$l + 2 \\le r$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print one integer â€” the number of suitable triplets.",
