  "statement": "One day, early in the morning, you decided to buy yourself a bag of chips in the nearby store. The store has chips of $$$n$$$ different flavors. A bag of the $$$i$$$-th flavor costs $$$a_i$$$ burles. The store may run out of some flavors, so you'll decide which one to buy after arriving there. But there are two major flaws in this plan: you have only coins of $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ burles; since it's morning, the store will ask you to pay in exact change, i. e. if you choose the $$$i$$$-th flavor, you'll have to pay exactly $$$a_i$$$ burles. Coins are heavy, so you'd like to take the least possible number of coins in total. That's why you are wondering: what is the minimum total number of coins you should take with you, so you can buy a bag of chips of any flavor in exact change?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of flavors in the store. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the cost of one bag of each flavor.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you need to buy one bag of any flavor you'll choose in exact change.",
