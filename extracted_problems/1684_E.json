  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. In one operation you can change any number in the array to any other non-negative integer. Let's define the cost of the array as $$$\\operatorname{DIFF}(a) - \\operatorname{MEX}(a)$$$, where $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of a set of non-negative integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set, and $$$\\operatorname{DIFF}$$$ is the number of different numbers in the array. For example, $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(\\{1, 2, 3\\}) = 0$$$, $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(\\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5\\}) = 3$$$. You should find the minimal cost of the array $$$a$$$ if you are allowed to make at most $$$k$$$ operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le k \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of operations that you are allowed to make. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output a single integer — minimal cost that it is possible to get making at most $$$k$$$ operations.",
