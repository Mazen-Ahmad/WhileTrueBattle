  "statement": "You are given a binary matrix $$$b$$$ (all elements of the matrix are $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$) of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. You need to construct a $$$n$$$ sets $$$A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$$$, for which the following conditions are satisfied: Each set is nonempty and consists of distinct integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ inclusive. All sets are distinct. For all pairs $$$(i,j)$$$ satisfying $$$1\\leq i, j\\leq n$$$, $$$b_{i,j}=1$$$ if and only if $$$A_i\\subsetneq A_j$$$. In other words, $$$b_{i, j}$$$ is $$$1$$$ if $$$A_i$$$ is a proper subset of $$$A_j$$$ and $$$0$$$ otherwise. Set $$$X$$$ is a proper subset of set $$$Y$$$, if $$$X$$$ is a nonempty subset of $$$Y$$$, and $$$X \\neq Y$$$. It's guaranteed that for all test cases in this problem, such $$$n$$$ sets exist. Note that it doesn't mean that such $$$n$$$ sets exist for all possible inputs. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 100$$$). The following $$$n$$$ lines contain a binary matrix $$$b$$$, the $$$j$$$-th character of $$$i$$$-th line denotes $$$b_{i,j}$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$. It's guaranteed that for all test cases in this problem, such $$$n$$$ sets exist.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ lines. For the $$$i$$$-th line, first output $$$s_i$$$ $$$(1 \\le s_i \\le n)$$$ — the size of the set $$$A_i$$$. Then, output $$$s_i$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ — the elements of the set $$$A_i$$$. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them. It's guaranteed that for all test cases in this problem, such $$$n$$$ sets exist.",
