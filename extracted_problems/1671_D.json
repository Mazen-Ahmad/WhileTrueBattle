  "statement": "You are given a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. You are also given $$$x$$$ integers $$$1, 2, \\dots, x$$$. You are asked to insert each of the extra integers into the sequence $$$a$$$. Each integer can be inserted at the beginning of the sequence, at the end of the sequence, or between any elements of the sequence. The score of the resulting sequence $$$a'$$$ is the sum of absolute differences of adjacent elements in it $$$\\left(\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{n+x-1} |a'_i - a'_{i+1}|\\right)$$$. What is the smallest possible score of the resulting sequence $$$a'$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, x \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence and the number of extra integers. The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print a single integer — the smallest sum of absolute differences of adjacent elements of the sequence after you insert the extra integers into it.",
