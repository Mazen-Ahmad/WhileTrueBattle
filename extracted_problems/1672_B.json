  "statement": "Let's call a string good if its length is at least $$$2$$$ and all of its characters are $$$\\texttt{A}$$$ except for the last character which is $$$\\texttt{B}$$$. The good strings are $$$\\texttt{AB},\\texttt{AAB},\\texttt{AAAB},\\ldots$$$. Note that $$$\\texttt{B}$$$ is not a good string. You are given an initially empty string $$$s_1$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times: Choose any position of $$$s_1$$$ and insert some good string in that position. Given a string $$$s_2$$$, can we turn $$$s_1$$$ into $$$s_2$$$ after some number of operations?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single string $$$s_2$$$ ($$$1 \\leq |s_2| \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$s_2$$$ consists of only the characters $$$\\texttt{A}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{B}$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s_2|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" YES \" (without quotes) if we can turn $$$s_1$$$ into $$$s_2$$$ after some number of operations, and \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output \" YES \" and \" NO \" in any case (for example, strings \" yEs \", \" yes \" and \" Yes \" will be recognized as a positive response).",
