  "statement": "It is known that a contest can be represented by a string $$$s$$$, consisting of uppercase Latin letters that denote problems. It is also known that a contest is difficult if it contains \" FFT \" or \" NTT \" as a contiguous substring. Your task is to rearrange the problem in contest $$$s$$$ in such a way that this contest is not difficult. If the initial contest is not difficult, you may leave it as it is.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$). Additional constraints on the input data: the total length of strings across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a string — a non-difficult contest that was obtained from $$$s$$$ by rearranging the letters. If there are multiple correct answers, you may output any. It can be shown that at least one correct answer always exists.",
