  "statement": "Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point $$$0$$$ to point $$$n$$$. The car starts moving from point $$$0$$$ at minute $$$0$$$. There are $$$k+1$$$ signs on the line at points $$$0, a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$, and Timur knows that the car will arrive there at minutes $$$0, b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_k$$$, respectively. The sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are strictly increasing with $$$a_k = n$$$. Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed . Timur has $$$q$$$ queries: each query will be an integer $$$d$$$, and Timur wants you to output how many minutes it takes the car to reach point $$$d$$$, rounded down to the nearest integer .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$q$$$, ($$$k \\leq n \\leq 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\leq k, q \\leq 10^5$$$) — the final destination, the number of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$; $$$a_i < a_{i+1}$$$ for every $$$1 \\leq i \\leq k-1$$$; $$$a_k = n$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$; $$$b_i < b_{i+1}$$$ for every $$$1 \\leq i \\leq k-1$$$). Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$d$$$ ($$$0 \\leq d \\leq n$$$) — the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for. The sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until the car reaches the point $$$d$$$, rounded down.",
