  "statement": "Burenka has two pictures $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, which are tables of the same size $$$n \\times m$$$. Each cell of each painting has a color — a number from $$$0$$$ to $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, and there are no repeating colors in any row or column of each of the two paintings, except color $$$0$$$. Burenka wants to get a picture $$$b$$$ from the picture $$$a$$$. To achieve her goal, Burenka can perform one of $$$2$$$ operations: swap any two rows of $$$a$$$ or any two of its columns. Tell Burenka if she can fulfill what she wants, and if so, tell her the sequence of actions. The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom, the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the sizes of the table. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \\ldots, a_{i, m}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_{i,j} \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the colors of the $$$i$$$-th row of picture $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that there are no identical colors in the same row or column, except color $$$0$$$. The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_{i, 1}, b_{i, 2}, \\ldots, b_{i, m}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq b_{i,j} \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the colors of the $$$i$$$-th row of picture $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that there are no identical colors in the same row or column, except color $$$0$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "In the first line print the number $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to achieve what Burenka wants, otherwise print the number of actions in your solution $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). It can be proved that if a solution exists, then there exists a solution where $$$k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. In the next $$$k$$$ lines print the operations. First print the type of the operation ($$$1$$$ — swap rows, $$$2$$$ — columns), and then print the two indices of rows or columns to which the operation is applied. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.",
