  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ distinct points $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ on the plane and a positive integer $$$R$$$. Find the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$, and for every possible $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) the distance from the point $$$p_k$$$ to the segment between points $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$ is at most $$$R$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$R$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3000$$$, $$$1 \\le R \\le 10^5$$$) â€” the number of points and the maximum distance between a point and a segment. Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^5$$$) that define the $$$i$$$-th point $$$p_i=(x_i, y_i)$$$. All points are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer does not change if the parameter $$$R$$$ is changed by at most $$$10^{-2}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print the number of suitable pairs $$$(i, j)$$$.",
