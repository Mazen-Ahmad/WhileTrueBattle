  "statement": "YouKn0wWho has two even integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Help him to find an integer $$$n$$$ such that $$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{18}$$$ and $$$n \\bmod x = y \\bmod n$$$. Here, $$$a \\bmod b$$$ denotes the remainder of $$$a$$$ after division by $$$b$$$. If there are multiple such integers, output any. It can be shown that such an integer always exists under the given constraints.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$2 \\le x, y \\le 10^9$$$, both are even ).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{18}$$$) that satisfies the condition mentioned in the statement. If there are multiple such integers, output any. It can be shown that such an integer always exists under the given constraints.",
