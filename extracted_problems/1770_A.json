  "statement": "Kiyora has $$$n$$$ whiteboards numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Initially, the $$$i$$$-th whiteboard has the integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it. Koxia performs $$$m$$$ operations. The $$$j$$$-th operation is to choose one of the whiteboards and change the integer written on it to $$$b_j$$$. Find the maximum possible sum of integers written on the whiteboards after performing all $$$m$$$ operations.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n,m \\le 100$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$).",
