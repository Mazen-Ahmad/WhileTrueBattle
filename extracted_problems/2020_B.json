  "statement": "Imagine you have $$$n$$$ light bulbs numbered $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Initially, all bulbs are on . To flip the state of a bulb means to turn it off if it used to be on, and to turn it on otherwise. Next, you do the following: for each $$$i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$, flip the state of all bulbs $$$j$$$ such that $$$j$$$ is divisible by $$$i^\\dagger$$$. After performing all operations, there will be several bulbs that are still on. Your goal is to make this number exactly $$$k$$$. Find the smallest suitable $$$n$$$ such that after performing the operations there will be exactly $$$k$$$ bulbs on. We can show that an answer always exists. $$$^\\dagger$$$ An integer $$$x$$$ is divisible by $$$y$$$ if there exists an integer $$$z$$$ such that $$$x = y\\cdot z$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le 10^{18}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ â€” the minimum number of bulbs.",
