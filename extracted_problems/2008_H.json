  "statement": "Sakurako will soon take a test. The test can be described as an array of integers $$$n$$$ and a task on it: Given an integer $$$x$$$, Sakurako can perform the following operation any number of times: Choose an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i\\le n$$$) such that $$$a_i\\ge x$$$; Change the value of $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_i-x$$$. Using this operation any number of times, she must find the minimum possible median$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of the array $$$a$$$. Sakurako knows the array but does not know the integer $$$x$$$. Someone let it slip that one of the $$$q$$$ values of $$$x$$$ will be in the next test, so Sakurako is asking you what the answer is for each such $$$x$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The median of an array of length $$$n$$$ is the element that stands in the middle of the sorted array (at the $$$\\frac{n+2}{2}$$$-th position for even $$$n$$$, and at the $$$\\frac{n+1}{2}$$$-th for odd)",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1\\le n,q\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le n$$$) — the elements of the array. The following $$$q$$$ lines each contain one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1\\le x\\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. The same guarantee applies to the sum of $$$q$$$ across all test cases.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$q$$$ integers — the answer for each query.",
