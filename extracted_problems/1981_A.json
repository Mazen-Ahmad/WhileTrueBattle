  "statement": "Turtle and Piggy are playing a number game. First, Turtle will choose an integer $$$x$$$, such that $$$l \\le x \\le r$$$, where $$$l, r$$$ are given. It's also guaranteed that $$$2l \\le r$$$. Then, Piggy will keep doing the following operation until $$$x$$$ becomes $$$1$$$: Choose an integer $$$p$$$ such that $$$p \\ge 2$$$ and $$$p \\mid x$$$ (i.e. $$$x$$$ is a multiple of $$$p$$$). Set $$$x$$$ to $$$\\frac{x}{p}$$$, and the score will increase by $$$1$$$. The score is initially $$$0$$$. Both Turtle and Piggy want to maximize the score. Please help them to calculate the maximum score.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$l, r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^9, 2l \\le r$$$) — The range where Turtle can choose the integer from.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum score.",
