  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a[0 \\dots n-1]$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. This array is called a \" valley \" if there exists exactly one subarray $$$a[l \\dots r]$$$ such that: $$$0 \\le l \\le r \\le n-1$$$, $$$a_l = a_{l+1} = a_{l+2} = \\dots = a_r$$$, $$$l = 0$$$ or $$$a_{l-1} > a_{l}$$$, $$$r = n-1$$$ or $$$a_r < a_{r+1}$$$. Here are three examples: The first image shows the array [$$$3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3$$$], it is a valley because only subarray with indices $$$l=r=3$$$ satisfies the condition. The second image shows the array [$$$1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6$$$], it is a valley because only subarray with indices $$$l=0, r=2$$$ satisfies the codition. The third image shows the array [$$$1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1$$$], it is not a valley because two subarrays $$$l=r=0$$$ and $$$l=r=6$$$ that satisfy the condition. You are asked whether the given array is a valley or not. Note that we consider the array to be indexed from $$$0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is smaller than $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" YES \" (without quotes) if the array is a valley, and \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \" and \" YES \" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
