  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. Define the cost of some array $$$t$$$ as follows: $$$$$$cost(t) = \\sum_{x \\in set(t) } last(x) - first(x),$$$$$$ where $$$set(t)$$$ is the set of all values in $$$t$$$ without repetitions, $$$first(x)$$$, and $$$last(x)$$$ are the indices of the first and last occurrence of $$$x$$$ in $$$t$$$, respectively. In other words, we compute the distance between the first and last occurrences for each distinct element and sum them up. You need to split the array $$$a$$$ into $$$k$$$ consecutive segments such that each element of $$$a$$$ belongs to exactly one segment and the sum of the cost of individual segments is minimum.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 35\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\min(n,100)$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Output the minimum sum of the cost of individual segments.",
