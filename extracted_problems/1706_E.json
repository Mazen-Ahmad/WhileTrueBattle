  "statement": "You are given a connected undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. Vertices of the graph are numbered by integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and edges of the graph are numbered by integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. Your task is to answer $$$q$$$ queries, each consisting of two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. The answer to each query is the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the following condition holds: For all pairs of integers $$$(a, b)$$$ such that $$$l\\le a\\le b\\le r$$$, vertices $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are reachable from one another using only the first $$$k$$$ edges (that is, edges $$$1, 2, \\ldots, k$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 10^5$$$, $$$1\\le m, q\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices, edges, and queries respectively. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1\\le u_i, v_i\\le n$$$) — ends of the $$$i$$$-th edge. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and there are no multiple edges or self-loops. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1\\le l\\le r\\le n$$$) — descriptions of the queries. It is guaranteed that that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$q$$$ integers — the answers to the queries.",
