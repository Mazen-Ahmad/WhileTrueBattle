  "statement": "Come, let's build a world where even the weak are not forgotten! —Kijin Seija, Double Dealing Characters Shinmyoumaru has a mallet that can turn objects bigger or smaller. She is testing it out on a sequence $$$a$$$ and a number $$$v$$$ whose initial value is $$$1$$$. She wants to make $$$v = \\gcd\\limits_{i\\ne j}\\{a_i\\cdot a_j\\}$$$ by no more than $$$10^5$$$ operations ($$$\\gcd\\limits_{i\\ne j}\\{a_i\\cdot a_j\\}$$$ denotes the $$$\\gcd$$$ of all products of two distinct elements of the sequence $$$a$$$). In each operation, she picks a subsequence $$$b$$$ of $$$a$$$, and does one of the followings: Enlarge : $$$v = v \\cdot \\mathrm{lcm}(b)$$$ Reduce : $$$v = \\frac{v}{\\mathrm{lcm}(b)}$$$ Note that she does not need to guarantee that $$$v$$$ is an integer, that is, $$$v$$$ does not need to be a multiple of $$$\\mathrm{lcm}(b)$$$ when performing Reduce. Moreover, she wants to guarantee that the total length of $$$b$$$ chosen over the operations does not exceed $$$10^6$$$. Fine a possible operation sequence for her. You don't need to minimize anything .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 10^5$$$) — the size of sequence $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\cdots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 10^6$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$. It can be shown that the answer exists.",
  "outputFormat": "The first line contains a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\leq k\\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of operations. The following $$$k$$$ lines contains several integers. For each line, the first two integers $$$f$$$ ($$$f\\in\\{0,1\\}$$$) and $$$p$$$ ($$$1\\le p\\le n$$$) stand for the option you choose ($$$0$$$ for Enlarge and $$$1$$$ for Reduce) and the length of $$$b$$$. The other $$$p$$$ integers of the line $$$i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_p$$$ ($$$1\\le i_1<i_2<\\ldots<i_p\\le n$$$) represents the indexes of the subsequence. Formally, $$$b_j=a_{i_j}$$$.",
