  "statement": "You have two binary strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You would like to make all the elements of both strings equal to $$$0$$$. Unfortunately, you can modify the contents of these strings using only the following operation: You choose two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$); For every $$$i$$$ that respects $$$l \\le i \\le r$$$, change $$$a_i$$$ to the opposite. That is, $$$a_i := 1 - a_i$$$; For every $$$i$$$ that respects either $$$1 \\le i < l$$$ or $$$r < i \\le n$$$, change $$$b_i$$$ to the opposite. That is, $$$b_i := 1 - b_i$$$. Your task is to determine if this is possible, and if it is, to find such an appropriate chain of operations. The number of operations should not exceed $$$n + 5$$$. It can be proven that if such chain of operations exists, one exists with at most $$$n + 5$$$ operations.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the strings. The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$a$$$, consisting only of characters 0 and 1 , of length $$$n$$$. The third line of each test case contains a binary string $$$b$$$, consisting only of characters 0 and 1 , of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print first \" YES \" if it's possible to make all the elements of both strings equal to $$$0$$$. Otherwise, print \" NO \". If the answer is \" YES \", on the next line print a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le n + 5$$$) — the number of operations. Then $$$k$$$ lines follows, each contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) — the description of the operation. If there are several correct answers, print any of them.",
