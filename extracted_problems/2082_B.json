  "statement": "Ecrade has an integer $$$x$$$. There are two kinds of operations. Replace $$$x$$$ with $$$\\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$$ is the greatest integer $$$\\le \\dfrac{x}{2}$$$. Replace $$$x$$$ with $$$\\left\\lceil \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rceil$$$, where $$$\\left\\lceil \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rceil$$$ is the smallest integer $$$\\ge \\dfrac{x}{2}$$$. Ecrade will perform exactly $$$n$$$ first operations and $$$m$$$ second operations in any order. He wants to know the minimum and the maximum possible value of $$$x$$$ after $$$n+m$$$ operations. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$n$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\le x, n, m \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print two integers in one line, representing the minimum and the maximum possible value of $$$x$$$ after $$$n + m$$$ operations.",
