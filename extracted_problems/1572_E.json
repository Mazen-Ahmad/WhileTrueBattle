  "statement": "You are given a strictly convex polygon with $$$n$$$ vertices. You will make $$$k$$$ cuts that meet the following conditions: each cut is a segment that connects two different nonadjacent vertices; two cuts can intersect only at vertices of the polygon. Your task is to maximize the area of the smallest region that will be formed by the polygon and those $$$k$$$ cuts.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 200$$$, $$$0 \\le k \\le n-3$$$). The following $$$n$$$ lines describe vertices of the polygon in anticlockwise direction. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ ($$$|x_i|, |y_i| \\le 10^8$$$) â€” the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th vertex. It is guaranteed that the polygon is convex and that no two adjacent sides are parallel.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer: the maximum possible area of the smallest region after making $$$k$$$ cuts multiplied by $$$2$$$.",
