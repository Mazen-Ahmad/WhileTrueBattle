  "statement": "Serval loves Brain Power and his brain power problem. Serval defines that a string $$$T$$$ is powerful iff $$$T$$$ can be obtained by concatenating some string $$$T'$$$ multiple times. Formally speaking, $$$T$$$ is powerful iff there exist a string $$$T'$$$ and an integer $$$k\\geq 2$$$ such that $$$$$$T=\\underbrace{T'+T'+\\dots+T'}_{k\\text{ times}}$$$$$$ For example, gogogo is powerful because it can be obtained by concatenating go three times, but power is not powerful. Serval has a string $$$S$$$ consists of lowercase English letters. He is curious about the longest powerful subsequence of $$$S$$$, and he only needs you to find out the length of it. If all the non-empty subsequences of $$$S$$$ is not powerful, the answer is considered to be $$$0$$$. A string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single string $$$S$$$ ($$$|S|\\leq 80$$$) consisting of lowercase English letters.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer â€” the length of the longest powerful subsequence of $$$S$$$. If all the non-empty subsequences of $$$S$$$ is not powerful, print $$$0$$$.",
