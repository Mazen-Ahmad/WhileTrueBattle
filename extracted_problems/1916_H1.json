  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only differences between the two versions of this problem are the constraints on $$$k$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved. You are given integers $$$n$$$, $$$p$$$ and $$$k$$$. $$$p$$$ is guaranteed to be a prime number. For each $$$r$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$, find the number of $$$n \\times n$$$ matrices $$$A$$$ of the field$$$^\\dagger$$$ of integers modulo $$$p$$$ such that the rank$$$^\\ddagger$$$ of $$$A$$$ is exactly $$$r$$$. Since these values are big, you are only required to output them modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) $$$^\\ddagger$$$ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra)",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$p$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18}$$$, $$$2 \\leq p < 998\\,244\\,353$$$, $$$0 \\leq k \\leq 5000$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$p$$$ is a prime number.",
