  "statement": "You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. In this problem, the $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of a collection of integers $$$c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_k$$$ is defined as the smallest positive integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$c$$$. The primality of an array $$$a_1,\\dots,a_n$$$ is defined as the number of pairs $$$(l,r)$$$ such that $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(a_l,\\dots,a_r)$$$ is a prime number. Find any permutation of $$$1,2,\\dots,n$$$ with the maximum possible primality among all permutations of $$$1,2,\\dots,n$$$. Note: A prime number is a number greater than or equal to $$$2$$$ that is not divisible by any positive integer except $$$1$$$ and itself. For example, $$$2,5,13$$$ are prime numbers, but $$$1$$$ and $$$6$$$ are not prime numbers. A permutation of $$$1,2,\\dots,n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers: a permutation of $$$1,2,\\dots,n$$$ that achieves the maximum possible primality. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
