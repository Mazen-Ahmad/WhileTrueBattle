  "statement": "You have $$$n$$$ stacks of blocks. The $$$i$$$-th stack contains $$$h_i$$$ blocks and it's height is the number of blocks in it. In one move you can take a block from the $$$i$$$-th stack (if there is at least one block) and put it to the $$$i + 1$$$-th stack. Can you make the sequence of heights strictly increasing? Note that the number of stacks always remains $$$n$$$: stacks don't disappear when they have $$$0$$$ blocks.",
  "inputFormat": "First line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4)$$$ — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n \\leq 100)$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_i$$$ $$$(0 \\leq h_i \\leq 10^9)$$$ — starting heights of the stacks. It's guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output YES if you can make the sequence of heights strictly increasing and NO otherwise. You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES , Yes , yes , yEs will all be recognized as positive answer).",
