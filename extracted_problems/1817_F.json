  "statement": "Quantum entanglement is when two particles link together in a certain way no matter how far apart they are in space. You are given a string $$$s$$$. A pair of its non-empty substrings $$$(a, b)$$$ is called entangled if there is a (possibly empty) link string $$$c$$$ such that: Every occurrence of $$$a$$$ in $$$s$$$ is immediately followed by $$$cb$$$; Every occurrence of $$$b$$$ in $$$s$$$ is immediately preceded by $$$ac$$$. In other words, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ occur in $$$s$$$ only as substrings of $$$acb$$$. Compute the total number of entangled pairs of substrings of $$$s$$$. A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) characters from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "The first and only line contains a string $$$s$$$ of lowercase English letters ($$$1 \\leq |s| \\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the string for which you should count pairs of entangled substrings.",
  "outputFormat": "Output a single integer, the number of entangled pairs of substrings of $$$s$$$.",
