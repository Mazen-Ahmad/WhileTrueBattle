  "statement": "NIT, the cleaver, is new in town! Thousands of people line up to orz him. To keep his orzers entertained, NIT decided to let them solve the following problem related to $$$\\operatorname{or} z$$$. Can you solve this problem too? You are given a 1-indexed array of $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a$$$, and an integer $$$z$$$. You can do the following operation any number (possibly zero) of times: Select a positive integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$. Then, simutaneously set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$(a_i\\operatorname{or} z)$$$ and set $$$z$$$ to $$$(a_i\\operatorname{and} z)$$$. In other words, let $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ respectively be the current values of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$z$$$. Then set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$(x\\operatorname{or}y)$$$ and set $$$z$$$ to $$$(x\\operatorname{and}y)$$$. Here $$$\\operatorname{or}$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{and}$$$ denote the bitwise operations OR and AND respectively. Find the maximum possible value of the maximum value in $$$a$$$ after any number (possibly zero) of operations.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$z$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 2000$$$, $$$0\\le z<2^{30}$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$,$$$a_2$$$,$$$\\ldots$$$,$$$a_n$$$ ($$$0\\le a_i<2^{30}$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer â€” the answer to the problem.",
