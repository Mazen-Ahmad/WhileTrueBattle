  "statement": "Allyn is playing a new strategy game called \"Accumulator Apex\". In this game, Allyn is given the initial value of an integer $$$x$$$, referred to as the accumulator, and $$$k$$$ lists of integers. Allyn can make multiple turns. On each turn, Allyn can withdraw the leftmost element from any non-empty list and add it to the accumulator $$$x$$$ if the resulting $$$x$$$ is non-negative. Allyn can end the game at any moment. The goal of the game is to get the largest possible value of the accumulator $$$x$$$. Please help Allyn find the largest possible value of the accumulator $$$x$$$ they can get in this game.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\leq x \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq k \\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the initial value of the accumulator $$$x$$$ and the number of lists. The next $$$k$$$ lines contain the description of lists: an integer $$$l_i$$$ ($$$l_i \\ge 1$$$) followed on the same line by $$$l_i$$$ elements of the list in the order from left to right. Each element of lists does not exceed $$$10^9$$$ by the absolute value, and the total size of all lists does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "The sole line of the output should contain the largest value of the accumulator $$$x$$$ Allyn can get.",
