  "statement": "You are given an array $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ different strings. Each string consists of $$$m$$$ lowercase Latin letters. You have to respond to $$$q$$$ queries. Each query contains a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m+1$$$. Count the number of indices $$$i$$$, such that the string $$$t$$$ can be obtained from the string $$$s_i$$$, if it is allowed to insert one letter in an arbitrary position.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le 10$$$) — the number of strings in the array and the length of each string. The following $$$n$$$ lines contain strings $$$s_i$$$. All of the given strings are different. The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. The following $$$q$$$ lines contain query strings $$$t$$$ of length $$$m + 1$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print the number of indices $$$i$$$, such that a string from the query can be obtained from the string $$$s_i$$$, if it is allowed to insert one letter in an arbitrary position.",
