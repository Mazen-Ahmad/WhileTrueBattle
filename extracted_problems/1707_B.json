  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. It is guaranteed that $$$a$$$ is sorted from small to large. For each operation, we generate a new array $$$b_i=a_{i+1}-a_{i}$$$ for $$$1 \\le i < n$$$. Then we sort $$$b$$$ from small to large, replace $$$a$$$ with $$$b$$$, and decrease $$$n$$$ by $$$1$$$. After performing $$$n-1$$$ operations, $$$n$$$ becomes $$$1$$$. You need to output the only integer in array $$$a$$$ (that is to say, you need to output $$$a_1$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\\le a_1\\le \\ldots\\le a_n \\le 5\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2.5\\cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$a_n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the answer on a new line.",
