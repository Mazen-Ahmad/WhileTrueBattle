  "statement": "Note the unusual memory limit. Silver Wolf gives you an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, she replaces an element in $$$a$$$. After each query, she asks you to output the maximum integer $$$k$$$ such that there exists an integer $$$x$$$ such that it is the $$$k$$$-majority of a subarray$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$a$$$. An integer $$$y$$$ is the $$$k$$$-majority of array $$$b$$$ if $$$y$$$ appears at least $$$\\lfloor \\frac{|b|+1}{2} \\rfloor +k$$$ times in $$$b$$$, where $$$|b|$$$ represents the length of $$$b$$$. Note that $$$b$$$ may not necessarily have a $$$k$$$-majority. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$b$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, q \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$ and the number of queries. The following line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$). The following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$, denoting the query that replaces $$$a_i$$$ with $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i, x \\leq n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
