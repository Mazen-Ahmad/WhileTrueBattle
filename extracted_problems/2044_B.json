  "statement": "A string consisting of only characters 'p', 'q', and 'w' is painted on a glass window of a store. Ship walks past the store, standing directly in front of the glass window, and observes string $$$a$$$. Ship then heads inside the store, looks directly at the same glass window, and observes string $$$b$$$. Ship gives you string $$$a$$$. Your job is to find and output $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a string $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \\leq |a| \\leq 100$$$) — the string Ship observes from outside the store. It is guaranteed that $$$a$$$ only contains characters 'p', 'q', and 'w'.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output string $$$b$$$, the string Ship observes from inside the store, on a new line.",
