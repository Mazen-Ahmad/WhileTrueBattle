  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$ and a sequence $$$a$$$ of $$$n-1$$$ integers, each element is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. You are asked to build a string of length $$$n$$$ such that: each letter is one of \" abcd \"; if $$$a_i=1$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th suffix of the string is lexicographically smaller than the $$$(i+1)$$$-th suffix; if $$$a_i=0$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th suffix of the string is lexicographically greater than the $$$(i+1)$$$-th suffix. You will be asked $$$q$$$ queries of form: $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n - 1$$$) — flip the value of $$$a_i$$$ (if $$$a_i=0$$$, then set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$1$$$, and vice versa). After each query print the number of different strings that satisfy the given constraints modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the string and the number of queries. The second line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$$$) — the constraints on suffixes of the string. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains a query: an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n - 1$$$) — flip the value of $$$a_i$$$ (if $$$a_i=0$$$, then set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$1$$$, and vice versa).",
