  "statement": "You are given an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). Find the number of subarrays of $$$a$$$ whose $$$\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ has an even number of divisors. In other words, find all pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$i \\le j$$$) such that $$$a_i \\oplus a_{i + 1} \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_j$$$ has an even number of divisors. For example, numbers $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$ or $$$6$$$ have an even number of divisors, while $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ — odd. Consider that $$$0$$$ has an odd number of divisors in this task. Here $$$\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ (or $$$\\oplus$$$) denotes the bitwise XOR operation . Print the number of subarrays but multiplied by 2022... Okay, let's stop. Just print the actual answer.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the number of subarrays, whose $$$\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ has an even number of divisors.",
