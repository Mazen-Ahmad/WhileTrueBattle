  "statement": "Tokitsukaze has a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. For each operation, she selects two numbers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ ($$$i \\ne j$$$; $$$1 \\leq i,j \\leq n$$$). If $$$a_i = a_j$$$, change one of them to $$$0$$$. Otherwise change both of them to $$$\\min(a_i, a_j)$$$. Tokitsukaze wants to know the minimum number of operations to change all numbers in the sequence to $$$0$$$. It can be proved that the answer always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of operations to change all numbers in the sequence to $$$0$$$.",
