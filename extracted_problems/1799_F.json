  "statement": "You have an array of positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, of length $$$n$$$. You are also given a positive integer $$$b$$$. You are allowed to perform the following operations (possibly several) times in any order: Choose some $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, and replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\lceil \\frac{a_i}{2} \\rceil$$$. Here, $$$\\lceil x \\rceil$$$ denotes the smallest integer not less than $$$x$$$. Choose some $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, and replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\max(a_i - b, 0)$$$. However, you must also follow these rules: You can perform at most $$$k_1$$$ operations of type 1 in total. You can perform at most $$$k_2$$$ operations of type 2 in total. For all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, you can perform at most $$$1$$$ operation of type 1 on element $$$a_i$$$. For all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, you can perform at most $$$1$$$ operation of type 2 on element $$$a_i$$$. The cost of an array is the sum of its elements. Find the minimum cost of $$$a$$$ you can achieve by performing these operations.",
  "inputFormat": "Input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$, the number of test cases ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$). The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$k_1$$$, and $$$k_2$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5000$$$, $$$1 \\le b \\le 10^9$$$, $$$0 \\le k_1, k_2 \\le n$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ describing the array $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the minimum cost of $$$a$$$ you can achieve by performing the operations.",
