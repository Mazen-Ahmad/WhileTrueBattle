  "statement": "You are the proud leader of a city in Ancient Berland. There are $$$n^2$$$ buildings arranged in a grid of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. The height of the building in row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ is $$$h_{i, j}$$$. The city is beautiful if no two adjacent by side buildings have the same height. In other words, it must satisfy the following: There does not exist a position $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, $$$1 \\leq j \\leq n - 1$$$) such that $$$h_{i, j} = h_{i, j + 1}$$$. There does not exist a position $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n - 1$$$, $$$1 \\leq j \\leq n$$$) such that $$$h_{i, j} = h_{i + 1, j}$$$. There are $$$n$$$ workers at company A, and $$$n$$$ workers at company B. Each worker can be hired at most once . It costs $$$a_i$$$ coins to hire worker $$$i$$$ at company A. After hiring, worker $$$i$$$ will: Increase the heights of all buildings in row $$$i$$$ by $$$1$$$. In other words, increase $$$h_{i, 1}, h_{i, 2}, \\ldots, h_{i, n}$$$ by $$$1$$$. It costs $$$b_j$$$ coins to hire worker $$$j$$$ at company B. After hiring, worker $$$j$$$ will: Increase the heights of all buildings in column $$$j$$$ by $$$1$$$. In other words, increase $$$h_{1, j}, h_{2, j}, \\ldots, h_{n, j}$$$ by $$$1$$$. Find the minimum number of coins needed to make the city beautiful, or report that it is impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 1000$$$) — the size of the grid. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_{i, 1}, h_{i, 2}, \\ldots, h_{i, n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le h_{i, j} \\le 10^9$$$) — the heights of the buildings in row $$$i$$$. The next line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the costs of hiring the workers at company A. The next line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_j \\le 10^9$$$) — the costs of hiring the workers at company B. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins needed, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.",
