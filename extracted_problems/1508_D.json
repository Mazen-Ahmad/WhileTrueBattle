  "statement": "Based on a peculiar incident at basketball practice, Akari came up with the following competitive programming problem! You are given $$$n$$$ points on the plane, no three of which are collinear. The $$$i$$$-th point initially has a label $$$a_i$$$, in such a way that the labels $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ form a permutation of $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$. You are allowed to modify the labels through the following operation: Choose two distinct integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$. Swap the labels of points $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, and finally Draw the segment between points $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$. A sequence of operations is valid if after applying all of the operations in the sequence in order, the $$$k$$$-th point ends up having the label $$$k$$$ for all $$$k$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ inclusive, and the drawn segments don't intersect each other internally. Formally, if two of the segments intersect, then they must do so at a common endpoint of both segments. In particular, all drawn segments must be distinct. Find any valid sequence of operations, or say that none exist.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of points. The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$, $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$), representing that the $$$i$$$-th point has coordinates $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ and initially has label $$$a_i$$$. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct, no three points are collinear, and the labels $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ form a permutation of $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "If it is impossible to perform a valid sequence of operations, print $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, print an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$$$) — the number of operations to perform, followed by $$$k$$$ lines, each containing two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, $$$i\\neq j$$$) — the indices of the points chosen for the operation. Note that you are not required to minimize or maximize the value of $$$k$$$. If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.",
