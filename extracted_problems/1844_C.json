  "statement": "You have discovered $$$n$$$ mysterious particles on a line with integer charges of $$$c_1,\\dots,c_n$$$. You have a device that allows you to perform the following operation: Choose a particle and remove it from the line. The remaining particles will shift to fill in the gap that is created. If there were particles with charges $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ directly to the left and right of the removed particle, they combine into a single particle of charge $$$x+y$$$. For example, if the line of particles had charges of $$$[-3,1,4,-1,5,-9]$$$, performing the operation on the $$$4$$$th particle will transform the line into $$$[-3,1,9,-9]$$$. If we then use the device on the $$$1$$$st particle in this new line, the line will turn into $$$[1,9,-9]$$$. You will perform operations until there is only one particle left. What is the maximum charge of this remaining particle that you can obtain?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1,\\dots,c_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le c_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer, the maximum charge of the remaining particle.",
