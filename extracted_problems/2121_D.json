  "statement": "You are given two arrays of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$. It is guaranteed that each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$2 \\cdot n$$$ appears in exactly one of the arrays. You need to perform a certain number of operations (possibly zero) so that both of the following conditions are satisfied: For each $$$1 \\leq i < n$$$, it holds that $$$a_i < a_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$b_i < b_{i + 1}$$$. For each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, it holds that $$$a_i < b_i$$$. During each operation, you can perform exactly one of the following three actions: Choose an index $$$1 \\leq i < n$$$ and swap the values $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i + 1}$$$. Choose an index $$$1 \\leq i < n$$$ and swap the values $$$b_i$$$ and $$$b_{i + 1}$$$. Choose an index $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ and swap the values $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. You do not need to minimize the number of operations, but the total number must not exceed $$$1709$$$. Find any sequence of operations that satisfies both conditions.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 40$$$) — the length of the arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 2 \\cdot n$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 2 \\cdot n$$$). It is guaranteed that each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$2 \\cdot n$$$ appears either in array $$$a$$$ or in array $$$b$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the sequence of operations. In the first line for each test case, output the number of operations $$$k$$$. Note that $$$0 \\leq k \\leq 1709$$$. In the following $$$k$$$ lines for each test case, output the operations themselves: If you want to swap the values $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i + 1}$$$, output two integers $$$1$$$ and $$$i$$$. Note that $$$1 \\leq i < n$$$. If you want to swap the values $$$b_i$$$ and $$$b_{i + 1}$$$, output two integers $$$2$$$ and $$$i$$$. Note that $$$1 \\leq i < n$$$. If you want to swap the values $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$, output two integers $$$3$$$ and $$$i$$$. Note that $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.",
