  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the versions is the constraints on $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$a_i$$$, and the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. Note the unusual memory limit. You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, and an integer $$$k$$$. The cost of an array of integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is $$$$$$\\max\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n}\\left(\\left \\lfloor \\frac{a_i}{p_i} \\right \\rfloor \\right) - \\min\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n}\\left(\\left \\lfloor \\frac{a_i}{p_i} \\right \\rfloor \\right).$$$$$$ Here, $$$\\lfloor \\frac{x}{y} \\rfloor$$$ denotes the integer part of the division of $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$. Find the minimum cost of an array $$$p$$$ such that $$$1 \\le p_i \\le k$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\ldots \\le a_n \\le 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible cost of an array $$$p$$$ satisfying the condition above.",
