  "statement": "In this problem, you are initially given an empty multiset. You have to process two types of queries: ADD $$$x$$$ — add an element equal to $$$2^{x}$$$ to the multiset; GET $$$w$$$ — say whether it is possible to take the sum of some subset of the current multiset and get a value equal to $$$w$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each of which contains two integers $$$t_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$, denoting the $$$i$$$-th query. If $$$t_i = 1$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th query is ADD $$$v_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le v_i \\le 29$$$). If $$$t_i = 2$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th query is GET $$$v_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le v_i \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each GET query, print YES if it is possible to choose a subset with sum equal to $$$w$$$, or NO if it is impossible.",
