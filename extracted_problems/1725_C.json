  "statement": "Pak Chanek has a mirror in the shape of a circle. There are $$$N$$$ lamps on the circumference numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$ in clockwise order. The length of the arc from lamp $$$i$$$ to lamp $$$i+1$$$ is $$$D_i$$$ for $$$1 \\leq i \\leq N-1$$$. Meanwhile, the length of the arc between lamp $$$N$$$ and lamp $$$1$$$ is $$$D_N$$$. Pak Chanek wants to colour the lamps with $$$M$$$ different colours. Each lamp can be coloured with one of the $$$M$$$ colours. However, there cannot be three different lamps such that the colours of the three lamps are the same and the triangle made by considering the three lamps as vertices is a right triangle (triangle with one of its angles being exactly $$$90$$$ degrees). The following are examples of lamp colouring configurations on the circular mirror. Figure 1. an example of an incorrect colouring because lamps $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$ form a right triangle Figure 2. an example of a correct colouring Figure 3. an example of a correct colouring Before colouring the lamps, Pak Chanek wants to know the number of distinct colouring configurations he can make. Count the number of distinct possible lamp colouring configurations, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$M$$$ ($$$1 \\le N \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\le M \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of lamps in the mirror and the number of different colours used. The second line contains $$$N$$$ integers $$$D_1, D_2, \\ldots, D_N$$$ ($$$1 \\le D_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the lengths of the arcs between the lamps in the mirror.",
