  "statement": "The city where Mocha lives in is called Zhijiang. There are $$$n+1$$$ villages and $$$2n-1$$$ directed roads in this city. There are two kinds of roads: $$$n-1$$$ roads are from village $$$i$$$ to village $$$i+1$$$, for all $$$1\\leq i \\leq n-1$$$. $$$n$$$ roads can be described by a sequence $$$a_1,\\ldots,a_n$$$. If $$$a_i=0$$$, the $$$i$$$-th of these roads goes from village $$$i$$$ to village $$$n+1$$$, otherwise it goes from village $$$n+1$$$ to village $$$i$$$, for all $$$1\\leq i\\leq n$$$. Mocha plans to go hiking with Taki this weekend. To avoid the trip being boring, they plan to go through every village exactly once . They can start and finish at any villages. Can you help them to draw up a plan?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 20$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^4$$$) — indicates that the number of villages is $$$n+1$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 1$$$). If $$$a_i=0$$$, it means that there is a road from village $$$i$$$ to village $$$n+1$$$. If $$$a_i=1$$$, it means that there is a road from village $$$n+1$$$ to village $$$i$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a line with $$$n+1$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th number is the $$$i$$$-th village they will go through. If the answer doesn't exist, print $$$-1$$$. If there are multiple correct answers, you can print any one of them.",
