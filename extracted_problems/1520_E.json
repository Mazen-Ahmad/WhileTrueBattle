  "statement": "You are playing the game \"Arranging The Sheep\". The goal of this game is to make the sheep line up. The level in the game is described by a string of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters ' . ' (empty space) and ' * ' (sheep). In one move, you can move any sheep one square to the left or one square to the right, if the corresponding square exists and is empty . The game ends as soon as the sheep are lined up, that is, there should be no empty cells between any sheep. For example, if $$$n=6$$$ and the level is described by the string \" **.*.. \", then the following game scenario is possible: the sheep at the $$$4$$$ position moves to the right, the state of the level: \" **..*. \"; the sheep at the $$$2$$$ position moves to the right, the state of the level: \" *.*.*. \"; the sheep at the $$$1$$$ position moves to the right, the state of the level: \" .**.*. \"; the sheep at the $$$3$$$ position moves to the right, the state of the level: \" .*.**. \"; the sheep at the $$$2$$$ position moves to the right, the state of the level: \" ..***. \"; the sheep are lined up and the game ends. For a given level, determine the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$). The second line of each test case contains a string of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters ' . ' (empty space) and ' * ' (sheep) â€” the description of the level. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.",
