  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct positive integers. Let's consider an infinite integer set $$$S$$$ which contains all integers $$$x$$$ that satisfy at least one of the following conditions: $$$x = a_i$$$ for some $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. $$$x = 2y + 1$$$ and $$$y$$$ is in $$$S$$$. $$$x = 4y$$$ and $$$y$$$ is in $$$S$$$. For example, if $$$a = [1,2]$$$ then the $$$10$$$ smallest elements in $$$S$$$ will be $$$\\{1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12\\}$$$. Find the number of elements in $$$S$$$ that are strictly smaller than $$$2^p$$$. Since this number may be too large, print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$p$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n, p \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5)$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9)$$$. It is guaranteed that all the numbers in $$$a$$$ are distinct.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer, the number of elements in $$$S$$$ that are strictly smaller than $$$2^p$$$. Remember to print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
