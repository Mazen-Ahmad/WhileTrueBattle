  "statement": "Given an array of integers $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_l$$$, every second, cosmic rays will cause all $$$s_i$$$ such that $$$i=1$$$ or $$$s_i\\neq s_{i-1}$$$ to be deleted simultaneously, and the remaining parts will be concatenated together in order to form the new array $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{l'}$$$. Define the strength of an array as the number of seconds it takes to become empty. You are given an array of integers compressed in the form of $$$n$$$ pairs that describe the array left to right. Each pair $$$(a_i,b_i)$$$ represents $$$a_i$$$ copies of $$$b_i$$$, i.e. $$$\\underbrace{b_i,b_i,\\cdots,b_i}_{a_i\\textrm{ times}}$$$. For each $$$i=1,2,\\dots,n$$$, please find the strength of the sequence described by the first $$$i$$$ pairs.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le3\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of sequence $$$a$$$. The next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers each $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le10^9,0\\le b_i\\le n$$$) — the pairs which describe the sequence. It is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$3\\cdot10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that for all $$$1\\le i<n$$$, $$$b_i\\neq b_{i+1}$$$ holds.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one line containing $$$n$$$ integers — the answer for each prefix of pairs.",
