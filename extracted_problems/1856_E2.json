  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The differences between the two versions are the constraint on $$$n$$$ and the time limit. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. You are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices rooted at vertex $$$1$$$. For some permutation$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, let $$$f(a)$$$ be the number of pairs of vertices $$$(u, v)$$$ such that $$$a_u < a_{\\operatorname{lca}(u, v)} < a_v$$$. Here, $$$\\operatorname{lca}(u,v)$$$ denotes the lowest common ancestor of vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. Find the maximum possible value of $$$f(a)$$$ over all permutations $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$). The second line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2,p_3,\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i < i$$$) indicating that there is an edge between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$.",
