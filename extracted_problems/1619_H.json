  "statement": "You are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements. A permutation of $$$n$$$ elements is an array of length $$$n$$$ containing each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once. For example, $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ and $$$[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]$$$ are permutations, but $$$[1, 2, 4]$$$ and $$$[4, 3, 2, 1, 2]$$$ are not permutations. You should perform $$$q$$$ queries. There are two types of queries: $$$1$$$ $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$ — swap $$$p_x$$$ and $$$p_y$$$. $$$2$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$k$$$ — print the number that $$$i$$$ will become if we assign $$$i = p_i$$$ $$$k$$$ times.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains three integers. The first integer is $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2$$$) — type of query. If $$$t = 1$$$, then the next two integers are $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n$$$; $$$x \\ne y$$$) — first-type query. If $$$t = 2$$$, then the next two integers are $$$i$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, k \\le n$$$) — second-type query. It is guaranteed that there is at least one second-type query.",
  "outputFormat": "For every second-type query, print one integer in a new line — answer to this query.",
