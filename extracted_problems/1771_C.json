  "statement": "Hossam has $$$n$$$ trainees. He assigned a number $$$a_i$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th trainee. A pair of the $$$i$$$-th and $$$j$$$-th ($$$i \\neq j$$$) trainees is called successful if there is an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$x \\geq 2$$$), such that $$$x$$$ divides $$$a_i$$$, and $$$x$$$ divides $$$a_j$$$. Hossam wants to know if there is a successful pair of trainees. Hossam is very tired now, so he asks you for your help!",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$), the number of test cases. A description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers, the number of each trainee $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print the answer â€” \" YES \" (without quotes) if there is a successful pair of trainees and \" NO \" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.",
