  "statement": "Turtle just learned how to multiply two integers in his math class, and he was very excited. Then Piggy gave him an integer $$$n$$$, and asked him to construct a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ consisting of integers which satisfied the following conditions: For all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le a_i \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$. For all $$$1 \\le i < j \\le n - 1$$$, $$$a_i \\cdot a_{i + 1} \\ne a_j \\cdot a_{j + 1}$$$. Of all such sequences, Piggy asked Turtle to find the one with the minimum number of distinct elements. Turtle definitely could not solve the problem, so please help him!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ — the elements of the sequence $$$a$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
