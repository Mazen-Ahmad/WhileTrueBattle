  "statement": "DJ Genki vs Gram - Einherjar Joker ⠀ You have some cards. An integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ is written on each card: specifically, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, you have $$$a_i$$$ cards which have the number $$$i$$$ written on them. There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have $$$k$$$ coins, so you can buy at most $$$k$$$ new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between $$$\\mathbf{1}$$$ and $$$\\mathbf{n}$$$ , inclusive. After buying the new cards, you must partition all your cards into decks, according to the following rules: all the decks must have the same size; there are no pairs of cards with the same value in the same deck. Find the maximum possible size of a deck after buying cards and partitioning them optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq k \\leq 10^{16}$$$) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^{10}$$$, $$$\\sum a_i \\geq 1$$$) — the number of cards of type $$$i$$$ you have at the beginning, for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible size of a deck if you operate optimally.",
