  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ elements numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the element $$$i$$$ has value $$$a_i$$$ and color $$$c_i$$$, initially, $$$c_i = 0$$$ for all $$$i$$$. The following operation can be applied: Select three elements $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i < j < k \\leq n$$$), such that $$$c_i$$$, $$$c_j$$$ and $$$c_k$$$ are all equal to $$$0$$$ and $$$a_i = a_k$$$, then set $$$c_j = 1$$$. Find the maximum value of $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n{c_i}$$$ that can be obtained after applying the given operation any number of times.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements. The second line consists of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the value of the $$$i$$$-th element.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer in a line — the maximum value of $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n{c_i}$$$ that can be obtained after applying the given operation any number of times.",
