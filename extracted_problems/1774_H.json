  "statement": "Ecrade bought a deck of cards numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Let the value of a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ be $$$\\min\\limits_{i = 1}^{n - k + 1}\\ \\sum\\limits_{j = i}^{i + k - 1}a_j$$$. Ecrade wants to find the most valuable one among all permutations of the cards. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,k$$$ ($$$4 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the largest possible value in the first line. Then in the second line, print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$, all $$$a_i$$$ are distinct) — the elements of the permutation that has the largest value. If there are multiple such permutations, output any of them.",
