  "statement": "The boy Smilo is learning algorithms with a teacher named Brukhovich. Over the course of the year, Brukhovich will administer $$$n$$$ exams. For each exam, its difficulty $$$a_i$$$ is known, which is a non-negative integer. Smilo doesn't like when the greatest common divisor of the difficulties of two consecutive exams is equal to $$$1$$$. Therefore, he considers the sadness of the academic year to be the number of such pairs of exams. More formally, the sadness is the number of indices $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n - 1$$$) such that $$$gcd(a_i, a_{i+1}) = 1$$$, where $$$gcd(x, y)$$$ is the greatest common divisor of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Brukhovich wants to minimize the sadness of the year of Smilo. To do this, he can set the difficulty of any exam to $$$0$$$. However, Brukhovich doesn't want to make his students' lives too easy. Therefore, he will perform this action no more than $$$k$$$ times. Help Smilo determine the minimum sadness that Brukhovich can achieve if he performs no more than $$$k$$$ operations. As a reminder, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ is the maximum integer that is a divisor of both $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ and is denoted as $$$gcd(x, y)$$$. In particular, $$$gcd(x, 0) = gcd(0, x) = x$$$ for any non-negative integer $$$x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the total number of exams and the maximum number of exams that can be simplified, respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n$$$ — the elements of array $$$a$$$, which are the difficulties of the exams ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum possible sadness that can be achieved by performing no more than $$$k$$$ operations.",
