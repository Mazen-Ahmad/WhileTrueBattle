  "statement": "Turtle gives you a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Turtle considers a pair of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$) to be a pleasant pair if and only if there exists an integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$i \\le k < j$$$ and both of the following two conditions hold: $$$s_k \\ne s_{k + 1}$$$; $$$s_k \\ne s_i$$$ or $$$s_{k + 1} \\ne s_j$$$. Besides, Turtle considers a pair of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$) to be a good pair if and only if $$$s_i = s_j$$$ or $$$(i, j)$$$ is a pleasant pair. Turtle wants to reorder the string $$$s$$$ so that the number of good pairs is maximized . Please help him!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the length of the string. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the string $$$s$$$ after reordering so that the number of good pairs is maximized. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
