  "statement": "There is an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers and a magic number $$$k$$$ ($$$k\\ge 1$$$, $$$k$$$ is an integer). Serval has constructed another array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where $$$b_i = a_i \\bmod k$$$ holds$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ for all $$$1\\leq i\\leq n$$$. Then, he shuffled $$$b$$$. You are given the two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. Find a possible magic number $$$k$$$. However, there is a small possibility that Serval fooled you, and such an integer does not exist. In this case, output $$$-1$$$. It can be shown that, under the constraints of the problem, if such an integer $$$k$$$ exists, then there exists a valid answer no more than $$$10^9$$$. And you need to guarantee that $$$k\\le 10^9$$$ in your output. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$a_i \\bmod k$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$a_i$$$ by $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 10^4$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\\leq a_i\\leq 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0\\leq b_i\\leq 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\leq k\\leq 10^9$$$) — the magic number you found. Print $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to find such an integer. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.",
