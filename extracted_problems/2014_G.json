  "statement": "What is done is done, and the spoilt milk cannot be helped. Little John is as little as night is day â€” he was known to be a giant, at possibly $$$2.1$$$ metres tall. It has everything to do with his love for milk. His dairy diary has $$$n$$$ entries, showing that he acquired $$$a_i$$$ pints of fresh milk on day $$$d_i$$$. Milk declines in freshness with time and stays drinkable for a maximum of $$$k$$$ days. In other words, fresh milk acquired on day $$$d_i$$$ will be drinkable between days $$$d_i$$$ and $$$d_i+k-1$$$ inclusive. Every day, Little John drinks drinkable milk, up to a maximum of $$$m$$$ pints. In other words, if there are less than $$$m$$$ pints of milk, he will drink them all and not be satisfied; if there are at least $$$m$$$ pints of milk, he will drink exactly $$$m$$$ pints and be satisfied, and it's a milk satisfaction day . Little John always drinks the freshest drinkable milk first. Determine the number of milk satisfaction days for Little John.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$), the number of test cases. The first line of each test case consists of three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\le n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k \\le 10^5$$$), the number of diary entries, the maximum pints needed for a milk satisfaction day, and the duration of milk's freshness. Then follow $$$n$$$ lines of each test case, each with two integers $$$d_i$$$ and $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1\\le d_i$$$, $$$a_i \\le 10^6$$$), the day on which the milk was acquired and the number of pints acquired. They are sorted in increasing values of $$$d_i$$$, and all values of $$$d_i$$$ are distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer, the number of milk satisfaction days .",
