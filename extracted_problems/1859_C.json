  "statement": "Andrey is just starting to come up with problems, and it's difficult for him. That's why he came up with a strange problem about permutations$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ and asks you to solve it. Can you do it? Let's call the cost of a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ the value of the expression: $$$(\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} p_i \\cdot i) - (\\max_{j = 1}^{n} p_j \\cdot j)$$$ . Find the maximum cost among all permutations of length $$$n$$$. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 30$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 250$$$) — the length of the permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum cost among all permutations of length $$$n$$$.",
