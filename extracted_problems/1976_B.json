  "statement": "You are given two integer arrays: array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n+1$$$. You can perform the following operations any number of times in any order: choose any element of the array $$$a$$$ and increase it by $$$1$$$; choose any element of the array $$$a$$$ and decrease it by $$$1$$$; choose any element of the array $$$a$$$, copy it and append the copy to the end of the array $$$a$$$. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of aforementioned operations (possibly zero) required to transform the array $$$a$$$ into the array $$$b$$$. It can be shown that under the constraints of the problem, it is always possible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$); the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$); the third line contains $$$n + 1$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_{n + 1}$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) required to transform the array $$$a$$$ into the array $$$b$$$.",
