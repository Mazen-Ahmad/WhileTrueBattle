  "statement": "In a carnival game, there is a huge pyramid of cans with $$$2023$$$ rows, numbered in a regular pattern as shown. If can $$$9^2$$$ is hit initially, then all cans colored red in the picture above would fall. You throw a ball at the pyramid, and it hits a single can with number $$$n^2$$$. This causes all cans that are stacked on top of this can to fall (that is, can $$$n^2$$$ falls, then the cans directly above $$$n^2$$$ fall, then the cans directly above those cans, and so on). For example, the picture above shows the cans that would fall if can $$$9^2$$$ is hit. What is the sum of the numbers on all cans that fall? Recall that $$$n^2 = n \\times n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^6$$$) — it means that the can you hit has label $$$n^2$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers on all cans that fall. Please note, that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++). For all valid inputs, the answer will always fit into 64-bit integer type.",
