  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ numbers and a number $$$k$$$. The value $$$a_i$$$ describes the weather on the $$$i$$$-th day: if it rains on the $$$i$$$-th day, then $$$a_i = 1$$$; otherwise, if the weather is good on the $$$i$$$-th day, then $$$a_i = 0$$$. Jean wants to visit as many peaks as possible. One hike to a peak takes exactly $$$k$$$ days, and during each of these days, the weather must be good ($$$a_i = 0$$$). That is, formally, he can start a hike on day $$$i$$$ only if all $$$a_j = 0$$$ for all $$$j$$$ $$$(i \\leq j \\leq i + k - 1)$$$. After each hike, before starting the next one, Jean must take a break of at least one day, meaning that on the day following a hike, he cannot go on another hike. Find the maximum number of peaks that Jean can visit.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ denotes the weather on the $$$i$$$-th day. It is guaranteed that the total value of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of hikes that Jean can make.",
