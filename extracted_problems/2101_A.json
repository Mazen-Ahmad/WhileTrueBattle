  "statement": "You are given $$$n^2$$$ cards with values from $$$0$$$ to $$$n^2-1$$$. You are to arrange them in a $$$n$$$ by $$$n$$$ grid such that there is exactly one card in each cell. The MEX (minimum excluded value) of a subgrid$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the subgrid. Your task is to arrange the cards such that the sum of MEX values over all $$$\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2$$$ subgrids is maximized. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A subgrid of a $$$n$$$ by $$$n$$$ grid is specified by four numbers $$$l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2$$$ satisfying $$$1\\le l_1\\le r_1\\le n$$$ and $$$1\\le l_2\\le r_2\\le n$$$. The element in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column of the grid is part of the subgrid if and only if $$$l_1\\le i\\le r_1$$$ and $$$l_2\\le j\\le r_2$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 500$$$) — the side length of the grid. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ lines, each containing $$$n$$$ integers representing the elements of the grid. If there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.",
