  "statement": "Red was ejected. They were not the imposter. There are $$$n$$$ rows of $$$m$$$ people. Let the position in the $$$r$$$-th row and the $$$c$$$-th column be denoted by $$$(r, c)$$$. Number each person starting from $$$1$$$ in row-major order, i.e., the person numbered $$$(r-1)\\cdot m+c$$$ is initially at $$$(r,c)$$$. The person at $$$(r, c)$$$ decides to leave. To fill the gap, let the person who left be numbered $$$i$$$. Each person numbered $$$j>i$$$ will move to the position where the person numbered $$$j-1$$$ is initially at. The following diagram illustrates the case where $$$n=2$$$, $$$m=3$$$, $$$r=1$$$, and $$$c=2$$$. Calculate the sum of the Manhattan distances of each person's movement. If a person was initially at $$$(r_0, c_0)$$$ and then moved to $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$, the Manhattan distance is $$$|r_0-r_1|+|c_0-c_1|$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The only line of each testcase contains $$$4$$$ integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$1\\le r\\le n\\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le c \\le m \\le 10^6$$$), where $$$n$$$ is the number of rows, $$$m$$$ is the number of columns, and $$$(r,c)$$$ is the position where the person who left is initially at.",
