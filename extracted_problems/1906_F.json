  "statement": "You are given a one-based array consisting of $$$N$$$ integers: $$$A_1, A_2, \\cdots, A_N$$$. Initially, the value of each element is set to $$$0$$$. There are $$$M$$$ operations (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$M$$$). Operation $$$i$$$ is represented by $$$\\langle L_i, R_i, X_i \\rangle$$$. If operation $$$i$$$ is executed, all elements $$$A_j$$$ for $$$L_i \\leq j \\leq R_i$$$ will be increased by $$$X_i$$$. You have to answer $$$Q$$$ independent queries. Each query is represented by $$$\\langle K, S, T \\rangle$$$ which represents the following task. Choose a range $$$[l, r]$$$ satisfying $$$S \\leq l \\leq r \\leq T$$$, and execute operations $$$l, l + 1, \\dots, r$$$. The answer to the query is the maximum value of $$$A_K$$$ after the operations are executed among all possible choices of $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line consists of two integers $$$N$$$ $$$M$$$ ($$$1 \\leq N, M \\leq 100\\,000$$$). Each of the next $$$M$$$ lines consists of three integers $$$L_i$$$ $$$R_i$$$ $$$X_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq N; -100\\,000 \\leq X_i \\leq 100\\,000$$$). The following line consists of an integer $$$Q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq Q \\leq 100\\,000$$$). Each of the next $$$Q$$$ lines consists of three integers $$$K$$$ $$$S$$$ $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\leq K \\leq N; 1 \\leq S \\leq T \\leq M$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, output in a single line, an integer which represent the answer of the query.",
