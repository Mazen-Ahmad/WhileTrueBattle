  "statement": "Vlad found a strip of $$$n$$$ cells, numbered from left to right from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. In the $$$i$$$-th cell, there is a positive integer $$$a_i$$$ and a letter $$$s_i$$$, where all $$$s_i$$$ are either ' L ' or ' R '. Vlad invites you to try to score the maximum possible points by performing any (possibly zero) number of operations. In one operation, you can choose two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l < r \\le n$$$) such that $$$s_l$$$ = ' L ' and $$$s_r$$$ = ' R ' and do the following: add $$$a_l + a_{l + 1} + \\dots + a_{r - 1} + a_r$$$ points to the current score; replace $$$s_i$$$ with ' . ' for all $$$l \\le i \\le r$$$, meaning you can no longer choose these indices. For example, consider the following strip: $$$3$$$ $$$5$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$2$$$ L R L L L R You can first choose $$$l = 1$$$, $$$r = 2$$$ and add $$$3 + 5 = 8$$$ to your score. $$$3$$$ $$$5$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$2$$$ . . L L L R Then choose $$$l = 3$$$, $$$r = 6$$$ and add $$$1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 10$$$ to your score. $$$3$$$ $$$5$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$2$$$ . . . . . . As a result, it is impossible to perform another operation, and the final score is $$$18$$$. What is the maximum score that can be achieved?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the strip. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — the numbers written on the strip. The third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters ' L ' and ' R '. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the maximum possible number of points that can be scored.",
