  "statement": "Hello, Codeforces Forcescode! Kevin used to be a participant of Codeforces. Recently, the KDOI Team has developed a new Online Judge called Forcescode. Kevin has participated in $$$n$$$ contests on Forcescode. In the $$$i$$$-th contest, his performance rating is $$$a_i$$$. Now he has hacked into the backend of Forcescode and will select an interval $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1\\le l\\le r\\le n$$$), then skip all of the contests in this interval. After that, his rating will be recalculated in the following way: Initially, his rating is $$$x=0$$$; For each $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$, after the $$$i$$$-th contest, If $$$l\\le i\\le r$$$, this contest will be skipped, and the rating will remain unchanged; Otherwise, his rating will be updated according to the following rules: If $$$a_i>x$$$, his rating $$$x$$$ will increase by $$$1$$$; If $$$a_i=x$$$, his rating $$$x$$$ will remain unchanged; If $$$a_i<x$$$, his rating $$$x$$$ will decrease by $$$1$$$. You have to help Kevin to find his maximum possible rating after the recalculation if he chooses the interval $$$[l,r]$$$ optimally. Note that Kevin has to skip at least one contest.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 5\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 3\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of contests. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le n$$$) — the performance ratings in the contests. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
