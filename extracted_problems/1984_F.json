  "statement": "There is a hidden array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ whose elements are integers between $$$-m$$$ and $$$m$$$, inclusive. You are given an array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters $$$\\texttt{P}$$$, $$$\\texttt{S}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{?}$$$. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ inclusive, we must have: If $$$s_i = \\texttt{P}$$$, $$$b_i$$$ is the sum of $$$a_1$$$ through $$$a_i$$$. If $$$s_i = \\texttt{S}$$$, $$$b_i$$$ is the sum of $$$a_i$$$ through $$$a_n$$$. Output the number of ways to replace all $$$\\texttt{?}$$$ in $$$s$$$ with either $$$\\texttt{P}$$$ or $$$\\texttt{S}$$$ such that there exists an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ with elements not exceeding $$$m$$$ by absolute value satisfying the constraints given by the array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ and the string $$$s$$$. Since the answer may be large, output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^3$$$, $$$2 \\leq m \\leq 10^{9}$$$) — the length of the hidden array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and the maximum absolute value of an element $$$a_i$$$. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters $$$\\texttt{P}$$$, $$$\\texttt{S}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{?}$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$|b_i| \\leq m \\cdot n$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^3$$$.",
