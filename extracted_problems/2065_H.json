  "statement": "Skibidus thinks he's Him! He proved it by solving this difficult task. Can you also prove yourself? Given a binary string$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$t$$$, $$$f(t)$$$ is defined as the minimum number of contiguous substrings, each consisting of identical characters, into which $$$t$$$ can be partitioned. For example, $$$f(\\texttt{00110001}) = 4$$$ because $$$t$$$ can be partitioned as $$$\\texttt{[00][11][000][1]}$$$ where each bracketed segment consists of identical characters. Skibidus gives you a binary string $$$s$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, a single character of the string is flipped (i.e. $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ changes to $$$\\texttt{1}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$ changes to $$$\\texttt{0}$$$); changes are saved after the query is processed. After each query, output the sum over all $$$f(b)$$$ where $$$b$$$ is a non-empty subsequence$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ of $$$s$$$, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A binary string consists of only characters $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A subsequence of a string is a string which can be obtained by removing several (possibly zero) characters from the original string.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq |s| \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The following line of each test case contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. The following line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq v_i \\leq |s|$$$), denoting $$$s_{v_i}$$$ is flipped for the $$$i$$$'th query. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
