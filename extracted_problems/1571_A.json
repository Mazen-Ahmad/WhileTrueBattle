  "statement": "Once upon a time, Petya had an array of integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. But over time, the array itself was lost, and only $$$n-1$$$ results of comparisons of neighboring array elements remained. In other words, for every $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$, Petya knows exactly one of these three facts: $$$a_i < a_{i+1}$$$; $$$a_i = a_{i+1}$$$; $$$a_i > a_{i+1}$$$. Petya wonders if it is possible to uniquely determine the result of comparing $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_n$$$. You have to help Petya determine the result of comparing $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_n$$$ or report that the result cannot be determined unambiguously.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The only line of the test case contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 100$$$), where $$$s_i$$$ is: < , if $$$a_i < a_{i + 1}$$$; > , if $$$a_i > a_{i + 1}$$$; = , if $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single string equal to: < , if $$$a_1 < a_n$$$; > , if $$$a_1 > a_n$$$; = , if $$$a_1 = a_n$$$; ? , if it is impossible to uniquely determine the result of the comparison.",
