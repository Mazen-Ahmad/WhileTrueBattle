  "statement": "Pak Chanek plans to build a garage. He wants the garage to consist of a square and a right triangle that are arranged like the following illustration. Define $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ as the lengths of two of the sides in the right triangle as shown in the illustration. An integer $$$x$$$ is suitable if and only if we can construct a garage with assigning positive integer values for the lengths $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$a<b$$$) so that the area of the square at the bottom is exactly $$$x$$$. As a good friend of Pak Chanek, you are asked to help him find the $$$N$$$-th smallest suitable number.",
  "inputFormat": "The only line contains a single integer $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "An integer that represents the $$$N$$$-th smallest suitable number.",
