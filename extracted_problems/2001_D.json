  "statement": "You are given an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Let $$$S$$$ be the set of all possible non-empty subsequences of $$$a$$$ without duplicate elements. Your goal is to find the longest sequence in $$$S$$$. If there are multiple of them, find the one that minimizes lexicographical order after multiplying terms at odd positions by $$$-1$$$. For example, given $$$a = [3, 2, 3, 1]$$$, $$$S = \\{[1], [2], [3], [2, 1], [2, 3], [3, 1], [3, 2], [2, 3, 1], [3, 2, 1]\\}$$$. Then $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$ and $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$ would be the longest, and $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$ would be the answer since $$$[-3, 2, -1]$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$[-2, 3, -1]$$$. A sequence $$$c$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$d$$$ if $$$c$$$ can be obtained from $$$d$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. A sequence $$$c$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a sequence $$$d$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$c$$$ is a prefix of $$$d$$$, but $$$c \\ne d$$$; in the first position where $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ differ, the sequence $$$c$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$d$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the answer in the following format: Output an integer $$$m$$$ in the first line — the length of $$$b$$$. Then output $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ in the second line — the sequence $$$b$$$.",
