  "statement": "You are given the sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The sequence of indices $$$i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k$$$ of length $$$k$$$ denotes the subsequence $$$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\ldots, a_{i_k}$$$ of length $$$k$$$ of sequence $$$a$$$. The subsequence $$$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\ldots, a_{i_k}$$$ of length $$$k$$$ of sequence $$$a$$$ is called increasing subsequence if $$$a_{i_j} < a_{i_{j+1}}$$$ for each $$$1 \\leq j < k$$$. The weight of the increasing subsequence $$$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\ldots, a_{i_k}$$$ of length $$$k$$$ of sequence $$$a$$$ is the number of $$$1 \\leq j \\leq k$$$, such that exists index $$$i_k < x \\leq n$$$ and $$$a_x > a_{i_j}$$$. For example, if $$$a = [6, 4, 8, 6, 5]$$$, then the sequence of indices $$$i = [2, 4]$$$ denotes increasing subsequence $$$[4, 6]$$$ of sequence $$$a$$$. The weight of this increasing subsequence is $$$1$$$, because for $$$j = 1$$$ exists $$$x = 5$$$ and $$$a_5 = 5 > a_{i_1} = 4$$$, but for $$$j = 2$$$ such $$$x$$$ doesn't exist. Find the sum of weights of all increasing subsequences of $$$a$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the sum of weights of all increasing subsequences $$$a$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
