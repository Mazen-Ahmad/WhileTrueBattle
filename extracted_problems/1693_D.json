  "statement": "Let's call an array $$$a$$$ of $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m$$$ Decinc if $$$a$$$ can be made increasing by removing a decreasing subsequence (possibly empty) from it. For example, if $$$a = [3, 2, 4, 1, 5]$$$, we can remove the decreasing subsequence $$$[a_1, a_4]$$$ from $$$a$$$ and obtain $$$a = [2, 4, 5]$$$, which is increasing. You are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Find the number of pairs of integers $$$(l, r)$$$ with $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$ such that $$$p[l \\ldots r]$$$ (the subarray of $$$p$$$ from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$) is a Decinc array.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of $$$p$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) — elements of the permutation.",
  "outputFormat": "Output the number of pairs of integers $$$(l, r)$$$ such that $$$p[l \\ldots r]$$$ (the subarray of $$$p$$$ from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$) is a Decinc array. $$$(1 \\le l \\le r \\le n)$$$",
