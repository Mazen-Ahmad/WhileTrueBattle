  "statement": "Kevin enjoys logic puzzles. He played a game with $$$n$$$ classmates who stand in a line. The $$$i$$$-th person from the left says that there are $$$a_i$$$ liars to their left (not including themselves). Each classmate is either honest or a liar, with the restriction that no two liars can stand next to each other . Honest classmates always say the truth. Liars can say either the truth or lies , meaning their statements are considered unreliable. Kevin wants to determine the number of distinct possible game configurations modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Two configurations are considered different if at least one classmate is honest in one configuration and a liar in the other.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of classmates. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the number of liars to the left of the $$$i$$$-th person they claimed. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the number of distinct game configurations modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
