  "statement": "You are given a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of $$$0$$$s and $$$1$$$s. You can perform the following operation on this sequence: Pick an index $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-2$$$ (inclusive). Change all of $$$a_{i}$$$, $$$a_{i+1}$$$, $$$a_{i+2}$$$ to $$$a_{i} \\oplus a_{i+1} \\oplus a_{i+2}$$$ simultaneously, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation Find a sequence of at most $$$n$$$ operations that changes all elements of $$$a$$$ to $$$0$$$s or report that it's impossible. We can prove that if there exists a sequence of operations of any length that changes all elements of $$$a$$$ to $$$0$$$s, then there is also such a sequence of length not greater than $$$n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i = 0$$$ or $$$a_i = 1$$$) — elements of $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, do the following: if there is no way of making all the elements of $$$a$$$ equal to $$$0$$$ after performing the above operation some number of times, print \" NO \". otherwise, in the first line print \" YES \", in the second line print $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$) — the number of operations that you want to perform on $$$a$$$, and in the third line print a sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le n - 2$$$) — the indices on which the operation should be applied. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any.",
