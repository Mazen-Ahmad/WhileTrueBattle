  "statement": "William really likes puzzle kits. For one of his birthdays, his friends gifted him a complete undirected edge-weighted graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. He wants to build a spanning tree of this graph, such that for the first $$$k$$$ vertices the following condition is satisfied: the degree of a vertex with index $$$i$$$ does not exceed $$$d_i$$$. Vertices from $$$k + 1$$$ to $$$n$$$ may have any degree. William wants you to find the minimum weight of a spanning tree that satisfies all the conditions. A spanning tree is a subset of edges of a graph that forms a tree on all $$$n$$$ vertices of the graph. The weight of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of weights of all the edges included in a spanning tree.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq min(n - 1, 5)$$$). The second line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq d_i \\leq n$$$). The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains $$$n - i$$$ integers $$$w_{i,i+1}, w_{i,i+2}, \\ldots, w_{i,n}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq w_{i,j} \\leq 100$$$): weights of edges $$$(i,i+1),(i,i+2),\\ldots,(i,n)$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer: the minimum weight of a spanning tree under given degree constraints for the first $$$k$$$ vertices.",
