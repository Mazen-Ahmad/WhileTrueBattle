  "statement": "Given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, find a range of values $$$[x, y]$$$ ($$$x \\le y$$$), and split $$$a$$$ into exactly $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) subarrays in such a way that: Each subarray is formed by several continuous elements of $$$a$$$, that is, it is equal to $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ for some $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$). Each element from $$$a$$$ belongs to exactly one subarray. In each subarray the number of elements inside the range $$$[x, y]$$$ (inclusive) is strictly greater than the number of elements outside the range. An element with index $$$i$$$ is inside the range $$$[x, y]$$$ if and only if $$$x \\le a_i \\le y$$$. Print any solution that minimizes $$$y - x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of subarrays required in the partition. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$k+1$$$ lines. In the first line, print $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ — the limits of the found range. Then print $$$k$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th should contain $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1\\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$) — the limits of the $$$i$$$-th subarray. You can print the subarrays in any order.",
