  "statement": "You are given a simple undirected connected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. There is a token in vertex $$$1$$$. We consider the initial time to be at $$$0$$$ seconds. After $$$t$$$ seconds, if the token is in vertex $$$u$$$, you must do exactly one of the following: wait one second, move the token through the $$$(t \\bmod \\mathrm{deg}(u) + 1)$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$-th edge of $$$u$$$, which takes one second. The order of edges of a vertex is the order that they appear in the input. Calculate the minimum time required to move the token from vertex $$$1$$$ to vertex $$$n$$$, and the minimum time spent waiting that can be achieved while minimizing the total time. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 5000$$$, $$$n - 1 \\leq m \\leq \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line containing two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n$$$) — the vertices of the $$$i$$$-th edge. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and simple. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing two integers — the minimum total time and the minimum waiting time that minimizes the total time, respectively.",
