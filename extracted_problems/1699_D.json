  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$ and an array $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$. In one operation, you can choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\lt n$$$) for which $$$a_i \\neq a_{i+1}$$$ and delete both $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$ from the array. After deleting $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$, the remaining parts of the array are concatenated. For example, if $$$a=[1,4,3,3,6,2]$$$, then after performing an operation with $$$i=2$$$, the resulting array will be $$$[1,3,6,2]$$$. What is the maximum possible length of an array of equal elements obtainable from $$$a$$$ by performing several (perhaps none) of the aforementioned operations?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5000$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10\\,000$$$.",
