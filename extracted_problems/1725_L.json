  "statement": "Pak Chanek is participating in a lemper cooking competition. In the competition, Pak Chanek has to cook lempers with $$$N$$$ stoves that are arranged sequentially from stove $$$1$$$ to stove $$$N$$$. Initially, stove $$$i$$$ has a temperature of $$$A_i$$$ degrees. A stove can have a negative temperature. Pak Chanek realises that, in order for his lempers to be cooked, he needs to keep the temperature of each stove at a non-negative value. To make it happen, Pak Chanek can do zero or more operations. In one operation, Pak Chanek chooses one stove $$$i$$$ with $$$2 \\leq i \\leq N-1$$$, then: changes the temperature of stove $$$i-1$$$ into $$$A_{i-1} := A_{i-1} + A_{i}$$$, changes the temperature of stove $$$i+1$$$ into $$$A_{i+1} := A_{i+1} + A_{i}$$$, and changes the temperature of stove $$$i$$$ into $$$A_i := -A_i$$$. Pak Chanek wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to do such that the temperatures of all stoves are at non-negative values. Help Pak Chanek by telling him the minimum number of operations needed or by reporting if it is not possible to do.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\le N \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of stoves. The second line contains $$$N$$$ integers $$$A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the initial temperatures of the stoves.",
  "outputFormat": "Output an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to make the temperatures of all stoves at non-negative values or output $$$-1$$$ if it is not possible.",
