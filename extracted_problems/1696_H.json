  "statement": "You are given a positive integer $$$k$$$. For a multiset of integers $$$S$$$, define $$$f(S)$$$ as the following. If the number of elements in $$$S$$$ is less than $$$k$$$, $$$f(S)=0$$$. Otherwise, define $$$f(S)$$$ as the maximum product you can get by choosing exactly $$$k$$$ integers from $$$S$$$. More formally, let $$$|S|$$$ denote the number of elements in $$$S$$$. Then, If $$$|S|<k$$$, $$$f(S)=0$$$. Otherwise, $$$f(S)=\\max\\limits_{T\\subseteq S,|T|=k}\\left(\\prod\\limits_{i\\in T}i\\right)$$$. You are given a multiset of integers, $$$A$$$. Compute $$$\\sum\\limits_{B\\subseteq A} f(B)$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. Note that in this problem, we distinguish the elements by indices instead of values . That is, a multiset consisting of $$$n$$$ elements always has $$$2^n$$$ distinct subsets regardless of whether some of its elements are equal.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, where $$$n$$$ is the number of elements in $$$A$$$ ($$$1\\le k\\le n\\le 600$$$). The second line of input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$, describing the elements in $$$A$$$ ($$$-10^9\\le a_i\\le 10^9$$$).",
