  "statement": "Sir Monocarp Hamilton is planning to paint his wall. The wall can be represented as a grid, consisting of $$$2$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. Initially, the wall is completely white. Monocarp wants to paint a black picture on the wall. In particular, he wants cell $$$(i, j)$$$ (the $$$j$$$-th cell in the $$$i$$$-th row) to be colored black, if $$$c_{i, j} =$$$ ' B ', and to be left white, if $$$c_{i, j} =$$$ ' W '. Additionally, he wants each column to have at least one black cell, so, for each $$$j$$$, the following constraint is satisfied: $$$c_{1, j}$$$, $$$c_{2, j}$$$ or both of them will be equal to ' B '. In order for the picture to turn out smooth, Monocarp wants to place down a paint brush in some cell $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and move it along the path $$$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_k, y_k)$$$ so that: for each $$$i$$$, $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ and $$$(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1})$$$ share a common side; all black cells appear in the path exactly once ; white cells don't appear in the path. Determine if Monocarp can paint the wall.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of columns in the wall. The $$$i$$$-th of the next two lines contains a string $$$c_i$$$, consisting of $$$m$$$ characters, where each character is either ' B ' or ' W '. $$$c_{i, j}$$$ is ' B ', if the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ should be colored black, and ' W ', if the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ should be left white. Additionally, for each $$$j$$$, the following constraint is satisfied: $$$c_{1, j}$$$, $$$c_{2, j}$$$ or both of them are equal to ' B '. The sum of $$$m$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
