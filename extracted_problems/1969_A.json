  "statement": "Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has $$$n$$$ friends, and he wants to have at least $$$2$$$ of them at his party. The $$$i$$$-th friend's best friend is $$$p_i$$$. All $$$p_i$$$ are distinct, and for every $$$i \\in [1, n]$$$, $$$p_i \\ne i$$$. Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The $$$i$$$-th friend comes to the party if both the $$$i$$$-th friend and the $$$p_i$$$-th friend receive an invitation (note that the $$$p_i$$$-th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends. For example, if $$$p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]$$$, and Monocarp sends invitations to the friends $$$[1, 2, 4, 5]$$$, then the friends $$$[2, 4, 5]$$$ will come to the party. The friend $$$1$$$ won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the friend $$$3$$$ won't come since he didn't receive an invitation. Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least $$$2$$$ friends come to the party.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the number of friends; the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$; $$$p_i \\ne i$$$; all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct).",
