  "statement": "You are given a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose an index $$$1\\le i\\le n - 3$$$. Then, swap $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_{i + 2}$$$, and $$$a_{i + 1}$$$ with $$$a_{i + 3}$$$ simultaneously. In other words, permutation $$$a$$$ will be transformed from $$$[\\ldots, a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}, \\ldots]$$$ to $$$[\\ldots, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}, a_{i}, a_{i+1}, \\ldots]$$$. Determine the lexicographically smallest permutation$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ that can be obtained by applying the above operation any number of times. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$An array $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $$$y$$$ of the same size if and only if the following holds: in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, the array $$$x$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of permutation $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of permutation $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest permutation that can be obtained by applying the above operation any number of times.",
