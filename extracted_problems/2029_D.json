  "statement": "You are given an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. You can perform the following operation at most $$$2\\cdot \\max(n,m)$$$ times: Choose three distinct vertices $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$, then for each of the edges $$$(a,b)$$$, $$$(b,c)$$$, and $$$(c,a)$$$, do the following: If the edge does not exist, add it. On the contrary, if it exists, remove it. A graph is called cool if and only if one of the following holds: The graph has no edges, or The graph is a tree. You have to make the graph cool by performing the above operations. Note that you can use at most $$$2\\cdot \\max(n,m)$$$ operations. It can be shown that there always exists at least one solution.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3\\le n\\le 10^5$$$, $$$0\\le m\\le \\min\\left(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2},2\\cdot 10^5\\right)$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges. Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1\\le u_i,v_i\\le n$$$) — the two nodes that the $$$i$$$-th edge connects. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple-edges in the given graph.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, in the first line output an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\le k\\le 2\\cdot \\max(n, m)$$$) — the number of operations. Then output $$$k$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th line containing three distinct integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$1\\le a,b,c\\le n$$$) — the three integers you choose in the $$$i$$$-th operation. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.",
