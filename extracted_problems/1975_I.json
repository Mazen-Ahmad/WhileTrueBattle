  "statement": "This is the way it always was. This is the way it always will be. All will be forgotten again soon... Jellyfish is playing a one-player card game called \"Slay the Spire\". There are $$$n$$$ cards in total numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th card has power $$$c_i$$$. There is a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. If $$$s_i = \\texttt{0}$$$, the $$$i$$$-th card is initially in the draw pile. If $$$s_i = \\texttt{1}$$$, the $$$i$$$-th card is initially in Jellyfish's hand. Jellyfish will repeat the following process until either her hand or the draw pile is empty. Let $$$x$$$ be the power of the card with the largest power in her hand. Place a single card with power $$$x$$$ back into the draw pile. Randomly draw $$$x$$$ cards from the draw pile. All subsets of $$$x$$$ cards from the draw pile have an equal chance of being drawn. If there are fewer than $$$x$$$ cards in the draw pile, Jellyfish will draw all cards. At the end of this process, find the probability that Jellyfish can empty the draw pile, modulo $$$1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$. Formally, let $$$M=1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 120$$$) — the number of cards. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq c_i \\leq n$$$) — the powers of the cards. It is guaranteed that $$$c_1 \\leq c_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq c_n$$$. The third line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. If $$$s_i = \\texttt{0}$$$, the $$$i$$$-th card is initially in the draw pile. If $$$s_i = \\texttt{1}$$$, the $$$i$$$-th card is initially in Jellyfish's hand. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$120^2$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the probability that Jellyfish can empty the draw pile modulo $$$1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$.",
