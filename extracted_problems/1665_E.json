  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Let's define the cost of the array $$$a$$$ as $$$\\displaystyle \\min_{i \\neq j} a_i | a_j$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation . There are $$$q$$$ queries. For each query you are given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$l < r$$$). For each query you should find the cost of the subarray $$$a_{l}, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_{r}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test case consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < 2^{30}$$$) — the elements of $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_j$$$, $$$r_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_j < r_j \\le n$$$) — the description of the $$$j$$$-th query. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print $$$q$$$ numbers, where the $$$j$$$-th number is the cost of array $$$a_{l_j}, a_{l_j + 1}, \\ldots, a_{r_j}$$$.",
