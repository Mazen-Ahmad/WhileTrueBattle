  "statement": "Dasha has $$$10^{100}$$$ coins. Recently, she found a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and some operations that allows to change this string (she can do each operation any number of times): Replace substring 00 of $$$s$$$ by 0 and receive $$$a$$$ coins. Replace substring 11 of $$$s$$$ by 1 and receive $$$b$$$ coins. Remove 0 from any position in $$$s$$$ and pay $$$c$$$ coins. It turned out that while doing this operations Dasha should follow the rule: It is forbidden to do two operations with the same parity in a row. Operations are numbered by integers $$$1$$$-$$$3$$$ in the order they are given above. Please, calculate what is the maximum profit Dasha can get by doing these operations and following this rule.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5, 1 \\leq a, b, c \\leq 10^9$$$). The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print the answer.",
