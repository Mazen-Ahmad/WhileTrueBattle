  "statement": "Doremy has $$$n$$$ buckets of paint which is represented by an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Bucket $$$i$$$ contains paint with color $$$a_i$$$. Let $$$c(l,r)$$$ be the number of distinct elements in the subarray $$$[a_l,a_{l+1},\\ldots,a_r]$$$. Choose $$$2$$$ integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$l \\leq r$$$ and $$$r-l-c(l,r)$$$ is maximized.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$l \\leq r$$$ and $$$r-l-c(l,r)$$$ is maximized. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any.",
