  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, string $$$t$$$ consists of only '0' and '1'. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. Kevin has a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Kevin can perform the following operation: Choose two adjacent blocks of $$$s$$$ and swap them. A block is a maximal substring$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of identical characters. Formally, denote $$$s[l,r]$$$ as the substring $$$s_l s_{l+1} \\ldots s_r$$$. A block is $$$s[l,r]$$$ satisfying: $$$l=1$$$ or $$$s_l\\not=s_{l-1}$$$. $$$s_l=s_{l+1} = \\ldots = s_{r}$$$. $$$r=n$$$ or $$$s_r\\not=s_{r+1}$$$. Adjacent blocks are two blocks $$$s[l_1,r_1]$$$ and $$$s[l_2,r_2]$$$ satisfying $$$r_1+1=l_2$$$. For example, if $$$s=\\mathtt{000}\\,\\mathbf{11}\\,\\mathbf{00}\\,\\mathtt{111}$$$, Kevin can choose the two blocks $$$s[4,5]$$$ and $$$s[6,7]$$$ and swap them, transforming $$$s$$$ into $$$\\mathtt{000}\\,\\mathbf{00}\\,\\mathbf{11}\\,\\mathtt{111}$$$. Given a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of '0', '1' and '?', Kevin wants to determine the minimum number of operations required to perform such that for any index $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i\\le n$$$), if $$$t_i\\not=$$$ '?' then $$$s_i=t_i$$$. If it is impossible, output $$$-1$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting of '0' and '1'. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$t$$$ consisting of '0' and '1' . It is guaranteed that the lengths of $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ are the same. It is guaranteed that the sum of the length of $$$s$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$4\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of operations required. If it is impossible, output $$$-1$$$.",
