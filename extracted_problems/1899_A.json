  "statement": "Vanya and Vova are playing a game. Players are given an integer $$$n$$$. On their turn, the player can add $$$1$$$ to the current integer or subtract $$$1$$$. The players take turns; Vanya starts. If after Vanya's move the integer is divisible by $$$3$$$, then he wins. If $$$10$$$ moves have passed and Vanya has not won, then Vova wins. Write a program that, based on the integer $$$n$$$, determines who will win if both players play optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The single line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" First \" without quotes if Vanya wins, and \" Second \" without quotes if Vova wins.",
