  "statement": "For an array $$$b$$$ of size $$$m$$$, we define: the maximum prefix position of $$$b$$$ is the smallest index $$$i$$$ that satisfies $$$b_1+\\ldots+b_i=\\max_{j=1}^{m}(b_1+\\ldots+b_j)$$$; the maximum suffix position of $$$b$$$ is the largest index $$$i$$$ that satisfies $$$b_i+\\ldots+b_m=\\max_{j=1}^{m}(b_j+\\ldots+b_m)$$$. You are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$y$$$ ($$$x > y$$$). Construct an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ satisfying: $$$a_i$$$ is either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$; the maximum prefix position of $$$a$$$ is $$$x$$$; the maximum suffix position of $$$a$$$ is $$$y$$$. If there are multiple arrays that meet the conditions, print any. It can be proven that such an array always exists under the given conditions.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. For each test case: The only line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$y$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5, 1 \\le y \\lt x \\le n)$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ in a new line.",
