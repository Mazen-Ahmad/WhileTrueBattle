  "statement": "To celebrate your birthday you have prepared a festive table! Now you want to seat as many guests as possible. The table can be represented as a rectangle with height $$$h$$$ and width $$$w$$$, divided into $$$h \\times w$$$ cells. Let $$$(i, j)$$$ denote the cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column of the rectangle ($$$1 \\le i \\le h$$$; $$$1 \\le j \\le w$$$). Into each cell of the table you can either put a plate or keep it empty. As each guest has to be seated next to their plate, you can only put plates on the edge of the table — into the first or the last row of the rectangle, or into the first or the last column. Formally, for each cell $$$(i, j)$$$ you put a plate into, at least one of the following conditions must be satisfied: $$$i = 1$$$, $$$i = h$$$, $$$j = 1$$$, $$$j = w$$$. To make the guests comfortable, no two plates must be put into cells that have a common side or corner. In other words, if cell $$$(i, j)$$$ contains a plate, you can't put plates into cells $$$(i - 1, j)$$$, $$$(i, j - 1)$$$, $$$(i + 1, j)$$$, $$$(i, j + 1)$$$, $$$(i - 1, j - 1)$$$, $$$(i - 1, j + 1)$$$, $$$(i + 1, j - 1)$$$, $$$(i + 1, j + 1)$$$. Put as many plates on the table as possible without violating the rules above.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines describes one test case and contains two integers $$$h$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$3 \\le h, w \\le 20$$$) — the height and the width of the table.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$h$$$ lines containing $$$w$$$ characters each. Character $$$j$$$ in line $$$i$$$ must be equal to $$$1$$$ if you are putting a plate into cell $$$(i, j)$$$, and $$$0$$$ otherwise. If there are multiple answers, print any. All plates must be put on the edge of the table. No two plates can be put into cells that have a common side or corner. The number of plates put on the table under these conditions must be as large as possible. You are allowed to print additional empty lines.",
