  "statement": "A beautiful binary matrix is a matrix that has ones on its edges and zeros inside. Examples of four beautiful binary matrices. Today, Sakurako was playing with a beautiful binary matrix of size $$$r \\times c$$$ and created a binary string $$$s$$$ by writing down all the rows of the matrix, starting from the first and ending with the $$$r$$$-th. More formally, the element from the matrix in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column corresponds to the $$$((i-1)*c+j)$$$-th element of the string. You need to check whether the beautiful matrix from which the string $$$s$$$ was obtained could be squared . In other words, you need to check whether the string $$$s$$$ could have been build from a square beautiful binary matrix (i.e., one where $$$r=c$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string. The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The string is always the result of writing out the strings of a beautiful matrix. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print \" Yes \", if the original matrix could have been square, and \" No \" otherwise.",
