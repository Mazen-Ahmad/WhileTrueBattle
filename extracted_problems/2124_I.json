  "statement": "Given an array $$$a$$$, define $$$f(a)$$$ as follows: Let $$$k$$$ be an integer with $$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$. Partition $$$a$$$ into $$$k$$$ subarrays$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$s_1,s_2,\\ldots,s_k$$$ such that $$$s_1+s_2+\\ldots+s_k=a$$$. Here, $$$+$$$ represents array concatenation. Let $$$b$$$ be an empty array. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ in order, append the minimum element of $$$s_i$$$ to the end of $$$b$$$. Over all possible $$$k$$$ and partitions, $$$f(a)$$$ is the value of $$$k$$$ such that there exists a partition that produces the lexicographically largest $$$b$$$$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$. You are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$$$. Please determine if there exists a permutation$$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$ $$$a$$$ such that $$$f([a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_i])=x_i$$$ for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. If there is a permutation, print one. If there are multiple possible answers, you may output any one. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$c$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$d$$$ if $$$c$$$ can be obtained from $$$d$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$An array $$$c$$$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $$$d$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$c$$$ is a prefix of $$$d$$$, but $$$c \\ne d$$$; or in the first position where $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ differ, the array $$$c$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$d$$$. $$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — denoting the length of the array $$$x$$$. The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq i$$$) — denoting the array $$$x$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if a permutation exists, and NO otherwise. Each letter may be outputted in uppercase or lowercase. You can output in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\" , \"yes\" , \"Yes\" , and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses. If the answer is positive, output the permutation of $$$n$$$ numbers on the next line.",
