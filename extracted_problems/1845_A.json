  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$, which you want to obtain. You have an unlimited supply of every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, except integer $$$x$$$ (there are no integer $$$x$$$ at all). You are allowed to take an arbitrary amount of each of these integers (possibly, zero). Can you make the sum of taken integers equal to $$$n$$$? If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of testcases. The only line of each testcase contains three integers $$$n, k$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le k \\le n \\le 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, in the first line, print \" YES \" or \" NO \" — whether you can take an arbitrary amount of each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, except integer $$$x$$$, so that their sum is equal to $$$n$$$. If you can, the second line should contain a single integer $$$m$$$ — the total amount of taken integers. The third line should contain $$$m$$$ integers — each of them from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, not equal to $$$x$$$, and their sum is $$$n$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
