  "statement": "Shirobon - FOX ⠀ You are given $$$n$$$ points on the $$$x$$$ axis, at increasing positive integer coordinates $$$x_1 < x_2 < \\ldots < x_n$$$. For each pair $$$(i, j)$$$ with $$$1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$$$, you draw the segment $$$[x_i, x_j]$$$. The segments are closed, i.e., a segment $$$[a, b]$$$ contains the points $$$a, a+1, \\ldots, b$$$. You are given $$$q$$$ queries. In the $$$i$$$-th query, you are given a positive integer $$$k_i$$$, and you have to determine how many points with integer coordinates are contained in exactly $$$k_i$$$ segments.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of points and the number of queries. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_1 < x_2 < \\ldots < x_n \\leq 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the $$$n$$$ points. The third line of each test case contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k_i \\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the parameters of the $$$q$$$ queries. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line with $$$q$$$ integers: the $$$i$$$-th integer is the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query.",
