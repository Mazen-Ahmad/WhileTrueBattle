  "statement": "A binary string$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$b$$$ of odd length $$$m$$$ is good if $$$b_i$$$ is the median$$$^\\ddagger$$$ of $$$b[1,i]^\\S$$$ for all odd indices $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq m$$$). For a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$, a binary string $$$b$$$ of length $$$2k-1$$$ is an extension of $$$a$$$ if $$$b_{2i-1}=a_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq i \\leq k$$$. For example, 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 and 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 are extensions of the string 1001 . String $$$x=$$$ 1011011 is not an extension of string $$$y=$$$ 1001 because $$$x_3 \\neq y_2$$$. Note that there are $$$2^{k-1}$$$ different extensions of $$$a$$$. You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Find the sum of the number of good extensions over all prefixes of $$$s$$$. In other words, find $$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(s[1,i])$$$, where $$$f(x)$$$ gives number of good extensions of string $$$x$$$. Since the answer can be quite large, you only need to find it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A binary string is a string whose elements are either $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$. $$$^\\ddagger$$$ For a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$2m-1$$$, the median of $$$a$$$ is the (unique) element that occurs at least $$$m$$$ times in $$$a$$$. $$$^\\S$$$ $$$a[l,r]$$$ denotes the string of length $$$r-l+1$$$ which is formed by the concatenation of $$$a_l,a_{l+1},\\ldots,a_r$$$ in that order.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$n$$$ is the length of the binary string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains the binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
