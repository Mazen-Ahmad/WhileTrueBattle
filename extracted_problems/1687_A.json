  "statement": "The enchanted forest got its name from the magical mushrooms growing here. They may cause illusions and generally should not be approached. — Perfect Memento in Strict Sense Marisa comes to pick mushrooms in the Enchanted Forest. The Enchanted forest can be represented by $$$n$$$ points on the $$$X$$$-axis numbered $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$. Before Marisa started, her friend, Patchouli, used magic to detect the initial number of mushroom on each point, represented by $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$. Marisa can start out at any point in the forest on minute $$$0$$$. Each minute, the followings happen in order: She moves from point $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$ ($$$|x-y|\\le 1$$$, possibly $$$y=x$$$). She collects all mushrooms on point $$$y$$$. A new mushroom appears on each point in the forest. Note that she cannot collect mushrooms on minute $$$0$$$. Now, Marisa wants to know the maximum number of mushrooms she can pick after $$$k$$$ minutes.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$, $$$1\\le k \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of positions with mushrooms and the time Marisa has, respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the initial number of mushrooms on point $$$1,2,\\ldots,n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the maximum number of mushrooms Marisa can pick after $$$k$$$ minutes.",
