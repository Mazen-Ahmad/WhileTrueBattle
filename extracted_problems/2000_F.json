  "statement": "You have $$$n$$$ rectangles, the $$$i$$$-th of which has a width of $$$a_i$$$ and a height of $$$b_i$$$. You can perform the following operation an unlimited number of times: choose a rectangle and a cell in it, and then color it. Each time you completely color any row or column, you earn $$$1$$$ point. Your task is to score at least $$$k$$$ points with as few operations as possible. Suppose you have a rectangle with a width of $$$6$$$ and a height of $$$3$$$. You can score $$$4$$$ points by coloring all the cells in any $$$4$$$ columns, thus performing $$$12$$$ operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The following are the descriptions of the test cases. The first line of each test case description contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000, 1 \\le k \\le 100$$$) — the number of rectangles in the case and the required number of points. The next $$$n$$$ lines contain the descriptions of the rectangles. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le 100$$$) — the width and height of the $$$i$$$-th rectangle. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to score at least $$$k$$$ points. If it is impossible to score at least $$$k$$$ points, output -1 .",
