  "statement": "A number is called powerful if it is a power of two or a factorial. In other words, the number $$$m$$$ is powerful if there exists a non-negative integer $$$d$$$ such that $$$m=2^d$$$ or $$$m=d!$$$, where $$$d!=1\\cdot 2\\cdot \\ldots \\cdot d$$$ (in particular, $$$0! = 1$$$). For example $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$, and $$$6$$$ are powerful numbers, because $$$1=1!$$$, $$$4=2^2$$$, and $$$6=3!$$$ but $$$7$$$, $$$10$$$, or $$$18$$$ are not. You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Find the minimum number $$$k$$$ such that $$$n$$$ can be represented as the sum of $$$k$$$ distinct powerful numbers, or say that there is no such $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows. A test case consists of only one line, containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 10^{12}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print the answer on a separate line. If $$$n$$$ can not be represented as the sum of distinct powerful numbers, print $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, print a single positive integer â€” the minimum possible value of $$$k$$$.",
