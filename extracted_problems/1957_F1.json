  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the two versions of this problem is the constraint on $$$k$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved. You are given an undirected tree of $$$n$$$ nodes. Each node $$$v$$$ has a value $$$a_v$$$ written on it. You have to answer queries related to the tree. You are given $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, you are given $$$5$$$ integers, $$$u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2, k$$$. Denote the count of nodes with value $$$c$$$ on path $$$u_1 \\rightarrow v_1$$$ with $$$x_c$$$, and the count of nodes with value $$$c$$$ on path $$$u_2 \\rightarrow v_2$$$ with $$$y_c$$$. If there are $$$z$$$ such values of $$$c$$$ such that $$$x_c \\neq y_c$$$, output any $$$\\min(z, k)$$$ such values in any order.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5$$$) — the value written on each node of the tree. Then $$$n - 1$$$ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n, u \\neq v$$$) denoting an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. The next line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. Then $$$q$$$ lines follow. Each line contains five integers $$$u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2, k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2 \\leq n$$$, $$$k = 1$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, output on a separate line. For a query, first output $$$\\min(z, k)$$$ and then on the same line, output any $$$\\min(z, k)$$$ values in any order which occur a different number of times in each path.",
