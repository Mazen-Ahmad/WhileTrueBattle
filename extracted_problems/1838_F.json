  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. There is an $$$n$$$ by $$$n$$$ grid of conveyor belts, in positions $$$(1, 1)$$$ through $$$(n, n)$$$ of a coordinate plane. Every other square in the plane is empty. Each conveyor belt can be configured to move boxes up (' ^ '), down (' v '), left (' < '), or right (' > '). If a box moves onto an empty square, it stops moving. However, one of the $$$n^2$$$ belts is stuck, and will always move boxes in the same direction, no matter how it is configured. Your goal is to perform a series of tests to determine which conveyor belt is stuck, and the direction in which it sends items. To achieve this, you can perform up to $$$25$$$ tests. In each test, you assign a direction to all $$$n^2$$$ belts, place a box on top of one of them, and then turn all of the conveyors on. One possible result of a query with $$$n=4$$$. In this case, the box starts at $$$(2, 2)$$$. If there were no stuck conveyor, it would end up at $$$(5, 4)$$$, but because of the stuck ' > ' conveyor at $$$(3, 3)$$$, it enters an infinite loop. The conveyors move the box around too quickly for you to see, so the only information you receive from a test is whether the box eventually stopped moving, and if so, the coordinates of its final position.",
