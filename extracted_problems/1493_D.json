  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You are asked to process $$$q$$$ queries of the following format: given integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$, multiply $$$a_i$$$ by $$$x$$$. After processing each query you need to output the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements of the array $$$a$$$. Since the answer can be too large, you are asked to output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers — $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$ before the changes. The next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries in the following format: each line contains two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le x \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$q$$$ lines: after processing each query output the GCD of all elements modulo $$$10^9+7$$$ on a separate line.",
