  "statement": "In Berland, a bus consists of a row of $$$n$$$ seats numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Passengers are advised to always board the bus following these rules: If there are no occupied seats in the bus, a passenger can sit in any free seat; Otherwise, a passenger should sit in any free seat that has at least one occupied neighboring seat. In other words, a passenger can sit in a seat with index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) only if at least one of the seats with indices $$$i-1$$$ or $$$i+1$$$ is occupied. Today, $$$n$$$ passengers boarded the bus. The array $$$a$$$ chronologically records the seat numbers they occupied. That is, $$$a_1$$$ contains the seat number where the first passenger sat, $$$a_2$$$ — the seat number where the second passenger sat, and so on. You know the contents of the array $$$a$$$. Determine whether all passengers followed the recommendations. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and $$$a$$$ = [$$$5, 4, 2, 1, 3$$$], then the recommendations were not followed, as the $$$3$$$-rd passenger sat in seat number $$$2$$$, while the neighboring seats with numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ were free.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following describes the input test cases. The first line of each test case contains exactly one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of seats in the bus and the number of passengers who boarded the bus. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the seats that the passengers occupied in chronological order. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ values across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, and that no passenger sits in an already occupied seat.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output on a separate line: \" YES \", if all passengers followed the recommendations; \" NO \" otherwise. You may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \", and \" YES \" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
