  "statement": "At the IT Campus \"NEIMARK\", there are training sessions in competitive programming — both individual and team-based! For the next team training session, $$$n$$$ students will attend, and the skill of the $$$i$$$-th student is given by a positive integer $$$a_i$$$. The coach considers a team strong if its strength is at least $$$x$$$. The strength of a team is calculated as the number of team members multiplied by the minimum skill among the team members. For example, if a team consists of $$$4$$$ members with skills $$$[5, 3, 6, 8]$$$, then the team's strength is $$$4 \\cdot min([5, 3, 6, 8]) = 12$$$. Output the maximum possible number of strong teams, given that each team must have at least one participant and every participant must belong to exactly one team.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of students in training and the minimum strength of a team to be considered strong. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the skill of each student. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
