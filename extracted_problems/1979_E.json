  "statement": "The Manhattan distance between two points $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ is defined as: $$$$$$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|.$$$$$$ We call a Manhattan triangle three points on the plane, the Manhattan distances between each pair of which are equal. You are given a set of pairwise distinct points and an even integer $$$d$$$. Your task is to find any Manhattan triangle, composed of three distinct points from the given set, where the Manhattan distance between any pair of vertices is equal to $$$d$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\le d \\le 4 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$d$$$ is even) — the number of points and the required Manhattan distance between the vertices of the triangle. The $$$(i + 1)$$$-th line of each test case contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^5$$$) — the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point. It is guaranteed that all points are pairwise distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output three distinct integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le i,j,k \\le n$$$) — the indices of the points forming the Manhattan triangle. If there is no solution, output \"$$$0\\ 0\\ 0$$$\" (without quotes). If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.",
