  "statement": "You have a string $$$a$$$ and a string $$$b$$$. Both of the strings have length $$$n$$$. There are at most $$$10$$$ different characters in the string $$$a$$$. You also have a set $$$Q$$$. Initially, the set $$$Q$$$ is empty. You can apply the following operation on the string $$$a$$$ any number of times: Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\leq i \\leq n$$$) and a lowercase English letter $$$c$$$. Add $$$a_i$$$ to the set $$$Q$$$ and then replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$c$$$. For example, Let the string $$$a$$$ be \"$$$\\tt{abecca}$$$\". We can do the following operations: In the first operation, if you choose $$$i = 3$$$ and $$$c = \\tt{x}$$$, the character $$$a_3 = \\tt{e}$$$ will be added to the set $$$Q$$$. So, the set $$$Q$$$ will be $$$\\{\\tt{e}\\}$$$, and the string $$$a$$$ will be \"$$$\\tt{ab\\underline{x}cca}$$$\". In the second operation, if you choose $$$i = 6$$$ and $$$c = \\tt{s}$$$, the character $$$a_6 = \\tt{a}$$$ will be added to the set $$$Q$$$. So, the set $$$Q$$$ will be $$$\\{\\tt{e}, \\tt{a}\\}$$$, and the string $$$a$$$ will be \"$$$\\tt{abxcc\\underline{s}}$$$\". You can apply any number of operations on $$$a$$$, but in the end, the set $$$Q$$$ should contain at most $$$k$$$ different characters . Under this constraint, you have to maximize the number of integer pairs $$$(l, r)$$$ ($$$1\\leq l\\leq r \\leq n$$$) such that $$$a[l,r] = b[l,r]$$$. Here, $$$s[l,r]$$$ means the substring of string $$$s$$$ starting at index $$$l$$$ (inclusively) and ending at index $$$r$$$ (inclusively).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$0\\leq k\\leq 10$$$) â€” the length of the two strings and the limit on different characters in the set $$$Q$$$. The second line contains the string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. There is at most $$$10$$$ different characters in the string $$$a$$$. The last line contains the string $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Both of the strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ contain only lowercase English letters. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer in a line, the maximum number of pairs $$$(l, r)$$$ satisfying the constraints.",
