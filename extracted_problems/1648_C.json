  "statement": "While looking at the kitchen fridge, the little boy Tyler noticed magnets with symbols, that can be aligned into a string $$$s$$$. Tyler likes strings, and especially those that are lexicographically smaller than another string, $$$t$$$. After playing with magnets on the fridge, he is wondering, how many distinct strings can be composed out of letters of string $$$s$$$ by rearranging them, so that the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the string $$$t$$$? Tyler is too young, so he can't answer this question. The alphabet Tyler uses is very large, so for your convenience he has already replaced the same letters in $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ to the same integers, keeping that different letters have been replaced to different integers. We call a string $$$x$$$ lexicographically smaller than a string $$$y$$$ if one of the followings conditions is fulfilled: There exists such position of symbol $$$m$$$ that is presented in both strings, so that before $$$m$$$-th symbol the strings are equal, and the $$$m$$$-th symbol of string $$$x$$$ is smaller than $$$m$$$-th symbol of string $$$y$$$. String $$$x$$$ is the prefix of string $$$y$$$ and $$$x \\neq y$$$. Because the answer can be too large, print it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 200\\,000$$$) — the lengths of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots, s_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le s_i \\le 200\\,000$$$) — letters of the string $$$s$$$. The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$t_1, t_2, t_3, \\ldots, t_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le t_i \\le 200\\,000$$$) — letters of the string $$$t$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single number — the number of strings lexicographically smaller than $$$t$$$ that can be obtained by rearranging the letters in $$$s$$$, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
