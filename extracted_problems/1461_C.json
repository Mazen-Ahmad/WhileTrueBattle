  "statement": "Ron is a happy owner of a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). Ron's permutation is subjected to $$$m$$$ experiments of the following type: ($$$r_i$$$, $$$p_i$$$). This means that elements in range $$$[1, r_i]$$$ (in other words, the prefix of length $$$r_i$$$) have to be sorted in ascending order with the probability of $$$p_i$$$. All experiments are performed in the same order in which they are specified in the input data. As an example, let's take a look at a permutation $$$[4, 2, 1, 5, 3]$$$ and an experiment ($$$3, 0.6$$$). After such an experiment with the probability of $$$60\\%$$$ the permutation will assume the form $$$[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]$$$ and with a $$$40\\%$$$ probability it will remain unchanged. You have to determine the probability of the permutation becoming completely sorted in ascending order after $$$m$$$ experiments.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \\le n, m \\le 10^5)$$$ — the length of the permutation and the number of experiments, respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\le a_i \\le n)$$$ — contents of the permutation. The following $$$m$$$ lines of each test case each contain an integer $$$r_i$$$ and a real number $$$p_i$$$ $$$(1 \\le r_i \\le n, 0 \\le p_i \\le 1)$$$ — the length of the prefix and the probability of it being sorted. All probabilities are given with at most $$$6$$$ decimal places. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$ ($$$\\sum n, \\sum m \\le 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single number — the probability that after all experiments the permutation becomes sorted in ascending order. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$. Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\\frac{|a - b|}{\\max{(1, |b|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$$$.",
