  "statement": "You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Since $$$n$$$ may be very large, you are given its binary representation. You should compute the number of triples $$$(a,b,c)$$$ with $$$0 \\leq a,b,c \\leq n$$$ such that $$$a \\oplus b$$$, $$$b \\oplus c$$$, and $$$a \\oplus c$$$ are the sides of a non-degenerate triangle. Here, $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation . You should output the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Three positive values $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ are the sides of a non-degenerate triangle if and only if $$$x+y>z$$$, $$$x+z>y$$$, and $$$y+z>x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first and only line contains the binary representation of an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$0 < n < 2^{200\\,000}$$$) without leading zeros. For example, the string 10 is the binary representation of the number $$$2$$$, while the string 1010 represents the number $$$10$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer â€” the number of triples $$$(a,b,c)$$$ satisfying the conditions described in the statement modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
