  "statement": "An array $$$a$$$ is called ugly if it contains at least one element which is equal to the sum of all elements before it . If the array is not ugly, it is beautiful . For example: the array $$$[6, 3, 9, 6]$$$ is ugly: the element $$$9$$$ is equal to $$$6 + 3$$$; the array $$$[5, 5, 7]$$$ is ugly: the element $$$5$$$ (the second one) is equal to $$$5$$$; the array $$$[8, 4, 10, 14]$$$ is beautiful: $$$8 \\ne 0$$$, $$$4 \\ne 8$$$, $$$10 \\ne 8 + 4$$$, $$$14 \\ne 8 + 4 + 10$$$, so there is no element which is equal to the sum of all elements before it. You are given an array $$$a$$$ such that $$$1 \\le a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\dots \\le a_n \\le 100$$$. You have to reorder the elements of $$$a$$$ in such a way that the resulting array is beautiful. Note that you are not allowed to insert new elements or erase existing ones, you can only change the order of elements of $$$a$$$. You are allowed to keep the array $$$a$$$ unchanged, if it is beautiful.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\dots \\le a_n \\le 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer as follows: if it is impossible to reorder the elements of $$$a$$$ in such a way that it becomes beautiful, print NO ; otherwise, in the first line, print YES . In the second line, print $$$n$$$ integers — any beautiful array which can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by reordering its elements. If there are multiple such arrays, print any of them.",
