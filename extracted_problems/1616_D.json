  "statement": "You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and an integer $$$x$$$. You need to select the maximum number of elements in the array, such that for every subsegment $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ containing strictly more than one element $$$(l < r)$$$, either: At least one element on this subsegment is not selected, or $$$a_l + a_{l+1} + \\ldots + a_r \\geq x \\cdot (r - l + 1)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10$$$): the number of test cases. The descriptions of $$$t$$$ test cases follow, three lines per test case. In the first line you are given one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50\\,000$$$): the number of integers in the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-100\\,000 \\leq a_i \\leq 100\\,000$$$). The third line contains one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$-100\\,000 \\leq x \\leq 100\\,000$$$).",
