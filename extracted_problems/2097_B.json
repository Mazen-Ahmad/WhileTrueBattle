  "statement": "Every airport has a baggage claim area, and Balbesovo Airport is no exception. At some point, one of the administrators at Sheremetyevo came up with an unusual idea: to change the traditional shape of the baggage claim conveyor from a carousel to a more complex form. Suppose that the baggage claim area is represented as a rectangular grid of size $$$n \\times m$$$. The administration proposed that the path of the conveyor should pass through the cells $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_{2k+1}$$$, where $$$p_i = (x_i, y_i)$$$. For each cell $$$p_i$$$ and the next cell $$$p_{i+1}$$$ (where $$$1 \\leq i \\leq 2k$$$), these cells must share a common side. Additionally, the path must be simple, meaning that for no pair of indices $$$i \\neq j$$$ should the cells $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$ coincide. Unfortunately, the route plan was accidentally spoiled by spilled coffee, and only the cells with odd indices of the path were preserved: $$$p_1, p_3, p_5, \\ldots, p_{2k+1}$$$. Your task is to determine the number of ways to restore the original complete path $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_{2k+1}$$$ given these $$$k+1$$$ cells. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 3 \\cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 1000$$$, $$$n \\cdot m \\ge 3$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac12 (n m - 1) \\right\\rfloor$$$) — the dimensions of the grid and a parameter defining the length of the path. Next, there are $$$k+1$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains two integers $$$x_{2i-1}$$$ and $$$y_{2i-1}$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_{2i-1} \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le y_{2i-1} \\le m$$$) — the coordinates of the cell $$$p_{2i-1}$$$ that lies on the path. It is guaranteed that all pairs $$$(x_{2i-1}, y_{2i-1})$$$ are distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of ways to restore the original complete path modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
