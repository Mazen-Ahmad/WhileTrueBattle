  "statement": "You are given an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$3m$$$ edges. The graph may contain multi-edges, but does not contain self-loops. The graph satisfies the following property: the given edges can be divided into $$$m$$$ groups of $$$3$$$, such that each group is a triangle. A triangle is defined as three edges $$$(a,b)$$$, $$$(b,c)$$$ and $$$(c,a)$$$ for some three distinct vertices $$$a,b,c$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a,b,c \\leq n$$$). Initially, each vertex $$$v$$$ has a non-negative integer weight $$$a_v$$$. For every edge $$$(u,v)$$$ in the graph, you should perform the following operation exactly once : Choose an integer $$$x$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$. Then increase both $$$a_u$$$ and $$$a_v$$$ by $$$x$$$. After performing all operations, the following requirement should be satisfied: if $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ are connected by an edge, then $$$a_u \\ne a_v$$$. It can be proven this is always possible under the constraints of the task. Output a way to do so, by outputting the choice of $$$x$$$ for each edge. It is easy to see that the order of operations does not matter. If there are multiple valid answers, output any.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 4 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — denoting the graph have $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$3m$$$ edges. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^6$$$) — the initial weights of each vertex. Then $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i < b_i < c_i \\leq n$$$) — denotes that three edges $$$(a_i,b_i)$$$, $$$(b_i,c_i)$$$ and $$$(c_i,a_i)$$$. Note that the graph may contain multi-edges: a pair $$$(x,y)$$$ may appear in multiple triangles. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$m$$$ lines of $$$3$$$ integers each. The $$$i$$$-th line should contains three integers $$$e_{ab},e_{bc},e_{ca}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq e_{ab}, e_{bc} , e_{ca} \\leq 4$$$), denoting the choice of value $$$x$$$ for edges $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$, $$$(b_i,c_i)$$$ and $$$(c_i, a_i)$$$ respectively.",
