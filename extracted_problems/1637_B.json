  "statement": "Let there be an array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_k$$$. Let there be a partition of this array into segments $$$[l_1; r_1], [l_2; r_2], \\ldots, [l_c; r_c]$$$, where $$$l_1 = 1$$$, $$$r_c = k$$$, and for any $$$2 \\leq i \\leq c$$$ holds that $$$r_{i-1} + 1 = l_i$$$. In other words, each element of the array belongs to exactly one segment. Let's define the cost of a partition as $$$$$$c + \\sum_{i = 1}^{c} \\operatorname{mex}(\\{b_{l_i}, b_{l_i + 1}, \\ldots, b_{r_i}\\}),$$$$$$ where $$$\\operatorname{mex}$$$ of a set of numbers $$$S$$$ is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set $$$S$$$. In other words, the cost of a partition is the number of segments plus the sum of MEX over all segments. Let's define the value of an array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_k$$$ as the maximum possible cost over all partitions of this array. You are given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Find the sum of values of all its subsegments. An array $$$x$$$ is a subsegment of an array $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "The input contains several test cases. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 30$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line for each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the length of the array. The second line contains a sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the array elements. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single integer — the answer to the problem.",
