  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers. Count the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i \\cdot a_j = i + j$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ cases follow. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 2 \\cdot n$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that all elements are distinct . It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i \\cdot a_j = i + j$$$.",
