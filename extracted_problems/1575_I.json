  "statement": "Chanek Jones is back, helping his long-lost relative Indiana Jones, to find a secret treasure in a maze buried below a desert full of illusions. The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with $$$n$$$ rooms numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and $$$n - 1$$$ tunnels connecting them such that it is possible to travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels. The $$$i$$$-th room ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) has $$$a_i$$$ illusion rate. To go from the $$$x$$$-th room to the $$$y$$$-th room, there must exist a tunnel between $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, and it takes $$$\\max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|)$$$ energy. $$$|z|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$z$$$. To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it. Chanek and Indiana would ask $$$q$$$ queries. There are two types of queries to be done: $$$1\\ u\\ c$$$ — The illusion rate of the $$$x$$$-th room is changed to $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq |c| \\leq 10^9$$$). $$$2\\ u\\ v$$$ — Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room $$$v$$$ if they are initially at room $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$$$). Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq |a_i| \\leq 10^9$$$) — inital illusion rate of each room. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$s_i$$$ and $$$t_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s_i, t_i \\leq n$$$), meaning there is a tunnel connecting $$$s_i$$$-th room and $$$t_i$$$-th room. The given edges form a tree. The next $$$q$$$ lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.",
  "outputFormat": "For each type $$$2$$$ query, output a line containing an integer — the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.",
