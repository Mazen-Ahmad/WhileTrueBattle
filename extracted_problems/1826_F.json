  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. There are $$$n$$$ distinct hidden points with real coordinates on a two-dimensional Euclidean plane. In one query, you can ask some line $$$ax + by + c = 0$$$ and get the projections of all $$$n$$$ points to this line in some order. The given projections are not exact, please read the interaction section for more clarity. Using the minimum number of queries, guess all $$$n$$$ points and output them in some order. Here minimality means the minimum number of queries required to solve any possible test case with $$$n$$$ points. The hidden points are fixed in advance and do not change throughout the interaction. In other words, the interactor is not adaptive. A projection of point $$$A$$$ to line $$$ax + by + c = 0$$$ is the point on the line closest to $$$A$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 50$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 25$$$) — the number of hidden points. For each test case, it is guaranteed that for any pair of hidden points, their $$$x$$$ coordinates differ by at least $$$1$$$. Analogously, $$$y$$$ coordinates of any pair also differ by at least $$$1$$$. Coordinates $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ of all hidden points do not exceed $$$100$$$ by absolute value.",
