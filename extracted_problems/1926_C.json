  "statement": "Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test. Vladislav wrote the integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, inclusive, on the board. Then he replaced each integer with the sum of its digits. What is the sum of the numbers on the board now? For example, if $$$n=12$$$ then initially the numbers on the board are: $$$$$$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.$$$$$$ Then after the replacement, the numbers become: $$$$$$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3.$$$$$$ The sum of these numbers is $$$1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51$$$. Thus, for $$$n=12$$$ the answer is $$$51$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the largest number Vladislav writes.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the end of the process.",
