  "statement": "Consider a permutation$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. We can introduce the following sum for it$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$: $$$$$$S(p) = \\sum_{1 \\le l \\le r \\le n} \\min(p_l, p_{l + 1}, \\ldots, p_r)$$$$$$ Let us consider all permutations of length $$$n$$$ with the maximum possible value of $$$S(p)$$$. Output the $$$k$$$-th of them in lexicographical$$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$order, or report that there are less than $$$k$$$ of them. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$For example: For the permutation $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ the value of $$$S(p)$$$ is equal to $$$\\min(1) + \\min(1, 2) + \\min(1, 2, 3) + \\min(2) + \\min(2, 3) + \\min(3) =$$$ $$$1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10$$$ For the permutation $$$[2, 4, 1, 3]$$$ the value of $$$S(p)$$$ is equal to $$$\\min(2) + \\min(2, 4) + \\min(2, 4, 1) + \\min(2, 4, 1, 3) \\ +$$$ $$$ \\min(4) + \\min(4, 1) + \\min(4, 1, 3) \\ +$$$ $$$\\min(1) + \\min(1, 3) \\ +$$$ $$$\\min(3) =$$$ $$$2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 17$$$. $$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$An array $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\ne b$$$; or in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the array $$$a$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^{12}$$$) — the length of the permutation and the index number of the desired permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there are less than $$$k$$$ suitable permutations, print $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, print the $$$k$$$-th suitable permutation.",
