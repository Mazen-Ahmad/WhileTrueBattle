  "statement": "Taisia has $$$n$$$ six-sided dice. Each face of the die is marked with a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$6$$$, each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$6$$$ is used once. Taisia rolls all $$$n$$$ dice at the same time and gets a sequence of values $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 6$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the value on the upper face of the $$$i$$$-th dice. The sum of this sequence is equal to $$$s$$$. Suddenly, Taisia's pet cat steals exactly one dice with maximum value $$$a_i$$$ and calculates the sum of the values on the remaining $$$n-1$$$ dice, which is equal to $$$r$$$. You only know the number of dice $$$n$$$ and the values of $$$s$$$, $$$r$$$. Restore a possible sequence $$$a$$$ that fulfills the constraints.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of testcases. Each testcase is given on a separate line and contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$s$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50$$$, $$$1 \\le r < s \\le 300$$$). It is guaranteed that a solution exists.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print: $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ in any order. It is guaranteed that such sequence exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.",
