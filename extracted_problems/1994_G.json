  "statement": "After winning another Bed Wars game, Masha and Olya wanted to relax and decided to play a new game. Masha gives Olya an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a number $$$s$$$. Now Olya's task is to find a non-negative number $$$x$$$ such that $$$\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\oplus x = s$$$. But she is very tired after a tight round, so please help her with this. But this task seemed too simple to them, so they decided to make the numbers larger (up to $$$2^k$$$) and provide you with their binary representation.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k, n \\cdot k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^6$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the length of the binary representation of all numbers. The second line contains a string of length $$$k$$$, consisting of zeros and ones — the binary representation of the number $$$s$$$, starting from the most significant bits. The next $$$n$$$ lines also contain strings of length $$$k$$$, consisting of zeros and ones, the $$$i$$$-th of these strings contains the binary representation of the number $$$a_i$$$, starting from the most significant bits. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $$$n \\cdot k$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a string of length $$$k$$$ on a separate line, consisting of zeros or ones — the binary representation of any suitable number $$$x$$$ ($$$x \\ge 0$$$), starting from the most significant bits, or $$$-1$$$ if such $$$x$$$ does not exist.",
