  "statement": "Suppose we partition the elements of an array $$$b$$$ into any number $$$k$$$ of non-empty multisets $$$S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_k$$$, where $$$k$$$ is an arbitrary positive integer. Define the score of $$$b$$$ as the maximum value of $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(S_1)$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$ + \\operatorname{MEX}(S_2) + \\ldots + \\operatorname{MEX}(S_k)$$$ over all possible partitions of $$$b$$$ for any integer $$$k$$$. Envy is given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Since he knows that calculating the score of $$$a$$$ is too easy for you, he instead asks you to calculate the sum of scores of all $$$2^n - 1$$$ non-empty subsequences of $$$a$$$.$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ Since this answer may be large, please output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of a collection of integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ that does not occur in the collection $$$c$$$. For example, $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([0,1,2,2]) = 3$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([1,2,2]) = 0$$$ $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deleting several (possibly, zero or all) elements.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i < n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
