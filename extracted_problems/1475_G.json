  "statement": "Polycarp found on the street an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements. Polycarp invented his criterion for the beauty of an array. He calls an array $$$a$$$ beautiful if at least one of the following conditions must be met for each different pair of indices $$$i \\ne j$$$: $$$a_i$$$ is divisible by $$$a_j$$$; or $$$a_j$$$ is divisible by $$$a_i$$$. For example, if: $$$n=5$$$ and $$$a=[7, 9, 3, 14, 63]$$$, then the $$$a$$$ array is not beautiful (for $$$i=4$$$ and $$$j=2$$$, none of the conditions above is met); $$$n=3$$$ and $$$a=[2, 14, 42]$$$, then the $$$a$$$ array is beautiful; $$$n=4$$$ and $$$a=[45, 9, 3, 18]$$$, then the $$$a$$$ array is not beautiful (for $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=4$$$ none of the conditions above is met); Ugly arrays upset Polycarp, so he wants to remove some elements from the array $$$a$$$ so that it becomes beautiful. Help Polycarp determine the smallest number of elements to remove to make the array $$$a$$$ beautiful.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output one integer — the minimum number of elements that must be removed to make the array $$$a$$$ beautiful.",
