  "statement": "You are an ambitious king who wants to be the Emperor of The Reals. But to do that, you must first become Emperor of The Integers. Consider a number axis. The capital of your empire is initially at $$$0$$$. There are $$$n$$$ unconquered kingdoms at positions $$$0<x_1<x_2<\\ldots<x_n$$$. You want to conquer all other kingdoms. There are two actions available to you: You can change the location of your capital (let its current position be $$$c_1$$$) to any other conquered kingdom (let its position be $$$c_2$$$) at a cost of $$$a\\cdot |c_1-c_2|$$$. From the current capital (let its current position be $$$c_1$$$) you can conquer an unconquered kingdom (let its position be $$$c_2$$$) at a cost of $$$b\\cdot |c_1-c_2|$$$. You cannot conquer a kingdom if there is an unconquered kingdom between the target and your capital. Note that you cannot place the capital at a point without a kingdom. In other words, at any point, your capital can only be at $$$0$$$ or one of $$$x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$$$. Also note that conquering a kingdom does not change the position of your capital. Find the minimum total cost to conquer all kingdoms. Your capital can be anywhere at the end.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows. The first line of each test case contains $$$3$$$ integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_1 < x_2 < \\ldots < x_n \\leq 10^8$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum cost to conquer all kingdoms.",
