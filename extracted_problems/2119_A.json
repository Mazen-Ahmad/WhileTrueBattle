  "statement": "r-906 & IA AI - Psychologic Disco You are given two non-negative integers $$$a, b$$$. You can apply two types of operations on $$$a$$$ any number of times and in any order: $$$a \\gets a + 1$$$. The cost of this operation is $$$x$$$; $$$a \\gets a \\oplus 1$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation . The cost of this operation is $$$y$$$. Now you are asked to make $$$a = b$$$. If it's possible, output the minimum cost; otherwise, report it.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains four integers $$$a, b, x, y$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 100, 1 \\le x, y \\le 10^7$$$) — the two integers given to you and the respective costs of two types of operations.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output an integer — the minimum cost to make $$$a = b$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.",
