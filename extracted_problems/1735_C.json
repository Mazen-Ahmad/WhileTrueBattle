  "statement": "There was a string $$$s$$$ which was supposed to be encrypted. For this reason, all $$$26$$$ lowercase English letters were arranged in a circle in some order, afterwards, each letter in $$$s$$$ was replaced with the one that follows in clockwise order, in that way the string $$$t$$$ was obtained. You are given a string $$$t$$$. Determine the lexicographically smallest string $$$s$$$ that could be a prototype of the given string $$$t$$$. A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ of the same length if and only if: in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter, that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 3 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$t$$$. The next line contains the string $$$t$$$ of the length $$$n$$$, containing lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing the lexicographically smallest string $$$s$$$ which could be a prototype of $$$t$$$.",
