  "statement": "Mark is cleaning a row of $$$n$$$ rooms. The $$$i$$$-th room has a nonnegative dust level $$$a_i$$$. He has a magical cleaning machine that can do the following three-step operation. Select two indices $$$i<j$$$ such that the dust levels $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_{i+1}$$$, $$$\\dots$$$, $$$a_{j-1}$$$ are all strictly greater than $$$0$$$. Set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_i-1$$$. Set $$$a_j$$$ to $$$a_j+1$$$. Mark's goal is to make $$$a_1 = a_2 = \\ldots = a_{n-1} = 0$$$ so that he can nicely sweep the $$$n$$$-th room. Determine the minimum number of operations needed to reach his goal.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rooms. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0\\leq a_i\\leq 10^9$$$) — the dust level of each room. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a line containing a single integer — the minimum number of operations. It can be proven that there is a sequence of operations that meets the goal.",
