  "statement": "We say an infinite sequence $$$a_{0}, a_{1}, a_2, \\ldots$$$ is non-increasing if and only if for all $$$i\\ge 0$$$, $$$a_i \\ge a_{i+1}$$$. There is an infinite right and down grid. The upper-left cell has coordinates $$$(0,0)$$$. Rows are numbered $$$0$$$ to infinity from top to bottom, columns are numbered from $$$0$$$ to infinity from left to right. There is also a non-increasing infinite sequence $$$a_{0}, a_{1}, a_2, \\ldots$$$. You are given $$$a_0$$$, $$$a_1$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$; for all $$$i>n$$$, $$$a_i=0$$$. For every pair of $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, the cell with coordinates $$$(x,y)$$$ (which is located at the intersection of $$$x$$$-th row and $$$y$$$-th column) is white if $$$y<a_x$$$ and black otherwise. Initially there is one doll named Jina on $$$(0,0)$$$. You can do the following operation. Select one doll on $$$(x,y)$$$. Remove it and place a doll on $$$(x,y+1)$$$ and place a doll on $$$(x+1,y)$$$. Note that multiple dolls can be present at a cell at the same time; in one operation, you remove only one. Your goal is to make all white cells contain $$$0$$$ dolls. What's the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the goal? Print the answer modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of input contains $$$n+1$$$ integers $$$a_0,a_1,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\\le a_i\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sequence $$$a$$$ is non-increasing .",
