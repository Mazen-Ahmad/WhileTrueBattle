  "statement": "You are given an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ and integer $$$k$$$. In one step you can either choose some index $$$i$$$ and decrease $$$a_i$$$ by one (make $$$a_i = a_i - 1$$$); or choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ and set $$$a_i$$$ equal to $$$a_j$$$ (make $$$a_i = a_j$$$). What is the minimum number of steps you need to make the sum of array $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{a_i} \\le k$$$? (You are allowed to make values of array negative).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^{15}$$$) — the size of array $$$a$$$ and upper bound on its sum. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array itself. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of steps to make $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{a_i} \\le k$$$.",
