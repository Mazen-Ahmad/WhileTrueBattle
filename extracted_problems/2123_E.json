  "statement": "Define the $$$\\mathrm{MEX}$$$ (minimum excluded value) of an array to be the smallest nonnegative integer not present in the array. For example, $$$\\mathrm{MEX}([2, 2, 1]) = 0$$$ because $$$0$$$ is not in the array. $$$\\mathrm{MEX}([3, 1, 0, 1]) = 2$$$ because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ are in the array but $$$2$$$ is not. $$$\\mathrm{MEX}([0, 3, 1, 2]) = 4$$$ because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$ are in the array but $$$4$$$ is not. You are given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ of nonnegative integers. For all $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\leq k \\leq n$$$), count the number of possible values of $$$\\mathrm{MEX}(a)$$$ after removing exactly $$$k$$$ values from $$$a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\\leq a_i\\leq n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing $$$n+1$$$ integers — the number of possible values of $$$\\mathrm{MEX}(a)$$$ after removing exactly $$$k$$$ values, for $$$k=0,1,\\dots,n$$$.",
