  "statement": "This is a simple version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\leq 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$n$$$ for all sets of input data does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. You are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Calculate the number of index pairs $$$1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$$$ such that $$$p_i \\cdot p_j$$$ is divisible by $$$i \\cdot j$$$ without remainder. A permutation is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once. For example, $$$[1]$$$, $$$[3,5,2,1,4]$$$, $$$[1,3,2]$$$ are permutations, while $$$[2,3,2]$$$, $$$[4,3,1]$$$, $$$[0]$$$ are not.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of sets of input data. Then follows their description. The first line of each set of input data contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$. The second line of each set of input data contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all sets of input data does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each set of input data, output the number of index pairs $$$1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$$$ such that $$$p_i \\cdot p_j$$$ is divisible by $$$i \\cdot j$$$ without remainder.",
