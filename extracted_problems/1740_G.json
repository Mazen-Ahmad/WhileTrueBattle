  "statement": "Pak Chanek has an $$$n \\times m$$$ grid of portals. The portal on the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column is denoted as portal $$$(i,j)$$$. The portals $$$(1,1)$$$ and $$$(n,m)$$$ are on the north-west and south-east corner of the grid respectively. The portal $$$(i,j)$$$ has two settings: Type $$$t_{i,j}$$$, which is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. Strength $$$s_{i,j}$$$, which is an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$ inclusive. Each portal has $$$4$$$ faces labelled with integers $$$0,1,2,3$$$, which correspond to the north, east, south, and west direction respectively. When a laser enters face $$$k$$$ of portal $$$(i, j)$$$ with speed $$$x_\\text{in}$$$, it leaves the portal going out of face $$$(k+2+t_{i,j}) \\bmod 4$$$ with speed $$$x_\\text{out} = \\max(x_\\text{in},s_{i,j})$$$. The portal also has to consume $$$x_\\text{out} - x_\\text{in}$$$ units of energy . Pak Chanek is very bored today. He will shoot $$$4nm$$$ lasers with an initial speed of $$$1$$$, one into each face of each portal. Each laser will travel throughout this grid of portals until it moves outside the grid or it has passed through $$$10^{100}$$$ portals. At the end, Pak Chanek thinks that a portal is good if and only if the total energy consumed by that portal modulo $$$2$$$ is equal to its type. Given the strength settings of all portals, find a way to assign the type settings of each portal such that the number of good portals is maximised.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 1000$$$) — the number of rows and columns in the grid. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers, with the $$$j$$$-th integer being $$$s_{i,j}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s_{i,j} \\leq 10^9$$$) — the strength of portal $$$(i, j)$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$n$$$ lines with each line containing a string of length $$$m$$$ consisting of characters $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ representing the type settings. The $$$j$$$-th character in the $$$i$$$-th string is the type setting of portal $$$(i, j)$$$. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.",
