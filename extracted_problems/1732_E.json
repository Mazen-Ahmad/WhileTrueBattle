  "statement": "You are given two arrays of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$. You need to handle $$$q$$$ queries of the following two types: $$$1$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ $$$x$$$: assign $$$a_i := x$$$ for all $$$l \\leq i \\leq r$$$; $$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$: find the minimum value of the following expression among all $$$l \\leq i \\leq r$$$: $$$$$$\\frac{\\operatorname{lcm}(a_i, b_i)}{\\gcd(a_i, b_i)}.$$$$$$ In this problem $$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, and $$$\\operatorname{lcm}(x, y)$$$ denotes the least common multiple of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, q \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of numbers in the arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ and the number of queries. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the elements of the array $$$b$$$. Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, $$$j$$$-th of which starts with an integer $$$t_j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t_j \\leq 2$$$) and means that the $$$j$$$-th query has type $$$t_j$$$. If $$$t_j = 1$$$, it is followed by three integers $$$l_j$$$, $$$r_j$$$, and $$$x_j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_j \\leq r_j \\leq n$$$, $$$1 \\leq x_j \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$). If $$$t_j = 2$$$, it is followed by two integers $$$l_j$$$ and $$$r_j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_j \\leq r_j \\leq n$$$). It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of type $$$2$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query of the second type, output the minimum value of the expression.",
