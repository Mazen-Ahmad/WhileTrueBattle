  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ distinct points on a plane. The coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point are $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. For each point $$$i$$$, find the nearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) point with integer coordinates that is not among the given $$$n$$$ points. If there are multiple such points — you can choose any of them. The Manhattan distance between two points $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ is $$$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of points in the set. The next $$$n$$$ lines describe points. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point. It is guaranteed that all points in the input are distinct.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$n$$$ lines. In the $$$i$$$-th line, print the point with integer coordinates that is not among the given $$$n$$$ points and is the nearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) to the $$$i$$$-th point from the input. Output coordinates should be in range $$$[-10^6; 10^6]$$$. It can be shown that any optimal answer meets these constraints. If there are several answers, you can print any of them.",
