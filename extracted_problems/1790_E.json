  "statement": "Vlad found two positive numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$a,b>0$$$). He discovered that $$$a \\oplus b = \\frac{a + b}{2}$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ means the bitwise exclusive OR , and division is performed without rounding.. Since it is easier to remember one number than two, Vlad remembered only $$$a\\oplus b$$$, let's denote this number as $$$x$$$. Help him find any suitable $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ or tell him that they do not exist.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input data contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. Each test case is described by a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le 2^{29}$$$) — the number that Vlad remembered.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As the answer, output $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 < a,b \\le 2^{32}$$$), such that $$$x = a \\oplus b = \\frac{a + b}{2}$$$. If there are several answers, output any of them. If there are no matching pairs, output -1 .",
