  "statement": "You are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (a permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array of length $$$n$$$ in which each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once). You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose two different elements $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ and erase them from the permutation; insert the minimum of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ into the permutation in such a way that it becomes the first element; insert the maximum of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ into the permutation in such a way that it becomes the last element. For example, if $$$p = [1, 5, 4, 2, 3]$$$ and we want to apply the operation to the elements $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$, then after the first step of the operation, the permutation becomes $$$p = [1, 4, 2]$$$; and after we insert the elements, it becomes $$$p = [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]$$$. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations described above to sort the permutation $$$p$$$ in ascending order (i. e. transform $$$p$$$ so that $$$p_1 < p_2 < \\dots < p_n$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of the test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the permutation. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ — the given permutation $$$p$$$. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations described above to sort the array $$$p$$$ in ascending order.",
