  "statement": "Trulicina gives you integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$k\\geq 2$$$ and $$$n\\cdot m\\equiv 0 \\pmod{k}$$$. Output a $$$n$$$ by $$$m$$$ grid of integers such that each of the following criteria hold: Each integer in the grid is between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$, inclusive. Each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ appears an equal number of times. No two cells that share an edge have the same integer. It can be shown that such a grid always exists. If there are multiple solutions, output any.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n\\cdot m\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5, 2\\leq k\\leq n\\cdot m, n\\cdot m\\equiv 0 \\pmod{k})$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n\\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ lines, each containing $$$m$$$ integers that satisfy the criteria. If there are multiple solutions, output any.",
