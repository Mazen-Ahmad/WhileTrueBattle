  "statement": "You have two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of equal length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters 0 and 1 , and an integer $$$k$$$. You need to make strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal. In one step, you can choose any substring of $$$a$$$ containing exactly $$$k$$$ characters 1 (and arbitrary number of characters 0 ) and reverse it. Formally, if $$$a = a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_n$$$, you can choose any integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) such that there are exactly $$$k$$$ ones among characters $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$, and set $$$a$$$ to $$$a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_{l-1} a_r a_{r-1} \\ldots a_l a_{r+1} a_{r+2} \\ldots a_n$$$. Find a way to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$ using at most $$$4n$$$ reversals of the above kind, or determine that such a way doesn't exist. The number of reversals doesn't have to be minimized.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$). Description of the test cases follows. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2000$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$). The second line contains string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The third line contains string $$$b$$$ of the same length. Both strings consist of characters 0 and 1 . It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it's impossible to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$ in at most $$$4n$$$ reversals, print a single integer $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, print an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\le m \\le 4n$$$), denoting the number of reversals in your sequence of steps, followed by $$$m$$$ pairs of integers $$$l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$), denoting the boundaries of the substrings of $$$a$$$ to be reversed, in chronological order. Each substring must contain exactly $$$k$$$ ones at the moment of reversal. Note that $$$m$$$ doesn't have to be minimized. If there are multiple answers, print any.",
