  "statement": "Let's call a string $$$s$$$ perfectly balanced if for all possible triplets $$$(t,u,v)$$$ such that $$$t$$$ is a non-empty substring of $$$s$$$ and $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ are characters present in $$$s$$$, the difference between the frequencies of $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in $$$t$$$ is not more than $$$1$$$. For example, the strings \" aba \" and \" abc \" are perfectly balanced but \" abb \" is not because for the triplet (\" bb \",' a ',' b '), the condition is not satisfied. You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters only. Your task is to determine whether $$$s$$$ is perfectly balanced or not. A string $$$b$$$ is called a substring of another string $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained by deleting some characters (possibly $$$0$$$) from the start and some characters (possibly $$$0$$$) from the end of $$$a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 2\\cdot 10^4$$$) denoting the number of testcases. Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contain a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1\\leq |s|\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$), consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" YES \" if $$$s$$$ is a perfectly balanced string, and \" NO \" otherwise. You may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\" , \"Yes\" , \"yes\" , \"yEs\" will all be recognized as positive answer).",
