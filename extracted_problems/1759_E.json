  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ astronauts working on some space station. An astronaut with the number $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) has power $$$a_i$$$. An evil humanoid has made his way to this space station. The power of this humanoid is equal to $$$h$$$. Also, the humanoid took with him two green serums and one blue serum. In one second , a humanoid can do any of three actions: to absorb an astronaut with power strictly less humanoid power ; to use green serum, if there is still one left; to use blue serum, if there is still one left. When an astronaut with power $$$a_i$$$ is absorbed, this astronaut disappears, and power of the humanoid increases by $$$\\lfloor \\frac{a_i}{2} \\rfloor$$$, that is, an integer part of $$$\\frac{a_i}{2}$$$. For example, if a humanoid absorbs an astronaut with power $$$4$$$, its power increases by $$$2$$$, and if a humanoid absorbs an astronaut with power $$$7$$$, its power increases by $$$3$$$. After using the green serum, this serum disappears, and the power of the humanoid doubles, so it increases by $$$2$$$ times. After using the blue serum, this serum disappears, and the power of the humanoid triples, so it increases by $$$3$$$ times. The humanoid is wondering what the maximum number of astronauts he will be able to absorb if he acts optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of each test contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — number of astronauts and $$$h$$$ ($$$1 \\le h \\le 10^6$$$) — the initial power of the humanoid. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^8$$$) — powers of astronauts. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, in a separate line, print the maximum number of astronauts that a humanoid can absorb.",
