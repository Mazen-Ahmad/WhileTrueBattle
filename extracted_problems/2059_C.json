  "statement": "Nikyr has started working as a queue manager at the company \"Black Contour.\" He needs to choose the order of servicing customers. There are a total of $$$n$$$ queues, each initially containing $$$0$$$ people. In each of the next $$$n$$$ moments of time, there are two sequential events: New customers arrive in all queues. More formally, at the $$$j$$$-th moment of time, the number of people in the $$$i$$$-th queue increases by a positive integer $$$a_{i,j}$$$. Nikyr chooses exactly one of the $$$n$$$ queues to be served at that moment in time. The number of customers in this queue becomes $$$0$$$. Let the number of people in the $$$i$$$-th queue after all events be $$$x_i$$$. Nikyr wants MEX$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ of the collection $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum value he can achieve with an optimal order of servicing the queues. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$y$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$c$$$. For example: $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([2,2,1])= 0$$$, since $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array. $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([3,1,0,1]) = 2$$$, since $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not. $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([0,3,1,2]) = 4$$$, since $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$ belong to the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 300$$$) — the number of queues and moments of time. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\ldots, a_{i,n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{i,j} \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of new customers in the $$$i$$$-th queue at each moment of time. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum value of $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n])$$$ that can be achieved.",
