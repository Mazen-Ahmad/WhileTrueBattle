  "statement": "Nikita is a student passionate about number theory and algorithms. He faces an interesting problem related to an array of numbers. Suppose Nikita has an array of integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He will call a subsequence$$$^\\dagger$$$ of the array special if its least common multiple (LCM) is not contained in $$$a$$$. The LCM of an empty subsequence is equal to $$$0$$$. Nikita wonders: what is the length of the longest special subsequence of $$$a$$$? Help him answer this question! $$$^\\dagger$$$ A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, $$$[5,2,3]$$$ is a subsequence of $$$[1,5,7,8,2,4,3]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest special subsequence of $$$a$$$.",
