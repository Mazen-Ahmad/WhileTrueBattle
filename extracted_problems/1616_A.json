  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. You choose any subset of the given numbers (possibly, none or all numbers) and negate these numbers (i. e. change $$$x \\to (-x)$$$). What is the maximum number of different values in the array you can achieve?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$): the number of test cases. The next lines contain the description of the $$$t$$$ test cases, two lines per a test case. In the first line you are given one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$): the number of integers in the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-100 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of different elements in the array that you can achieve negating numbers in the array.",
