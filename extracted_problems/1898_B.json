  "statement": "Milena has received an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ from a secret admirer. She thinks that making it non-decreasing should help her identify the secret admirer. She can use the following operation to make this array non-decreasing: Select an element $$$a_i$$$ of array $$$a$$$ and an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\le x < a_i$$$. Then, replace $$$a_i$$$ by two elements $$$x$$$ and $$$a_i - x$$$ in array $$$a$$$. New elements ($$$x$$$ and $$$a_i - x$$$) are placed in the array $$$a$$$ in this order instead of $$$a_i$$$. More formally, let $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_i, \\ldots, a_k$$$ be an array $$$a$$$ before the operation. After the operation, it becomes equal to $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{i-1}, x, a_i - x, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_k$$$. Note that the length of $$$a$$$ increases by $$$1$$$ on each operation. Milena can perform this operation multiple times (possibly zero). She wants you to determine the minimum number of times she should perform this operation to make array $$$a$$$ non-decreasing. An array $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k$$$ of length $$$k$$$ is called non-decreasing if $$$x_i \\le x_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i < k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10\\,000$$$). The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 10^9$$$) – the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of operations required to make the array non-decreasing. It can be shown that it is always possible to make the array $$$a$$$ non-decreasing in the finite number of operations.",
