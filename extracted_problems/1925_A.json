  "statement": "You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Your task is to find a string $$$s$$$ such that all possible strings of length $$$n$$$ that can be formed using the first $$$k$$$ lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of $$$s$$$. If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them. Note: A string $$$a$$$ is called a subsequence of another string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from $$$b$$$ without changing the order of the remaining characters.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 676$$$) denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 26$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\leq k\\leq 26$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line containing a single string $$$s$$$ which satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.",
