  "statement": "You are given two integer arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, each of length $$$n$$$. You may perform the following operation any number of times: Choose an index $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \\le i \\le n - 1)$$$, and set $$$a_i := b_{i + 1}$$$, or set $$$b_i := a_{i + 1}$$$. Before performing any operations, you are allowed to choose an index $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \\le i \\le n)$$$ and remove both $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ from the arrays. This removal can be done at most once . Let the number of matches between two arrays $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ of length $$$m$$$ be the number of positions $$$j$$$ $$$(1 \\le j \\le m)$$$ such that $$$c_j = d_j$$$. Your task is to compute the maximum number of matches you can achieve.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\le t \\le 10^4)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows. The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$$$ — the length of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\le a_i \\le n)$$$ — the elements of $$$a$$$. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ $$$(1 \\le b_i \\le n)$$$ — the elements of $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the answer for the test case.",
