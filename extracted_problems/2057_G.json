  "statement": "Every Saturday, Alexander B., a teacher of parallel X, writes a secret message to Alexander G., a teacher of parallel B, in the evening. Since Alexander G. is giving a lecture at that time and the message is very important, Alexander B. has to write this message on an interactive online board. The interactive online board is a grid consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, where each cell is $$$1 \\times 1$$$ in size. Some cells of this board are already filled in, and it is impossible to write a message in them; such cells are marked with the symbol \" . \", while the remaining cells are called free and are marked with the symbol \" # \". Let us introduce two characteristics of the online board: $$$s$$$ is the number of free cells. $$$p$$$ is the perimeter of the grid figure formed by the union of free cells. Let $$$A$$$ be the set of free cells. Your goal is to find a set of cells $$$S \\subseteq A$$$ that satisfies the following properties: $$$|S| \\le \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot (s+p)$$$. Any cell from $$$A$$$ either lies in $$$S$$$ or shares a side with some cell from $$$S$$$. We can show that at least one set $$$S$$$ satisfying these properties exists; you are required to find any suitable one.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 80\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. In the first line of each test case, the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^6$$$) — the dimensions of the grid are given. The following $$$n$$$ lines contain the description of the grid. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ lines consisting of $$$m$$$ symbols, where each symbol encodes the state of the cell: \" # \" — the cell is in $$$A$$$ but not in $$$S$$$; \" S \" — the cell is in both $$$A$$$ and $$$S$$$; \" . \" — the cell is neither in $$$A$$$ nor in $$$S$$$.",
