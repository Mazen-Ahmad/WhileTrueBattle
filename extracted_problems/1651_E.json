  "statement": "Let's denote the size of the maximum matching in a graph $$$G$$$ as $$$\\mathit{MM}(G)$$$. You are given a bipartite graph. The vertices of the first part are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the vertices of the second part are numbered from $$$n+1$$$ to $$$2n$$$. Each vertex's degree is $$$2$$$ . For a tuple of four integers $$$(l, r, L, R)$$$, where $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$ and $$$n+1 \\le L \\le R \\le 2n$$$, let's define $$$G'(l, r, L, R)$$$ as the graph which consists of all vertices of the given graph that are included in the segment $$$[l, r]$$$ or in the segment $$$[L, R]$$$, and all edges of the given graph such that each of their endpoints belongs to one of these segments. In other words, to obtain $$$G'(l, r, L, R)$$$ from the original graph, you have to remove all vertices $$$i$$$ such that $$$i \\notin [l, r]$$$ and $$$i \\notin [L, R]$$$, and all edges incident to these vertices. Calculate the sum of $$$\\mathit{MM}(G(l, r, L, R))$$$ over all tuples of integers $$$(l, r, L, R)$$$ having $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$ and $$$n+1 \\le L \\le R \\le 2n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 1500$$$) — the number of vertices in each part. Then $$$2n$$$ lines follow, each denoting an edge of the graph. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le n$$$; $$$n + 1 \\le y_i \\le 2n$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th edge. There are no multiple edges in the given graph, and each vertex has exactly two incident edges.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer — the sum of $$$\\mathit{MM}(G(l, r, L, R))$$$ over all tuples of integers $$$(l, r, L, R)$$$ having $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$ and $$$n+1 \\le L \\le R \\le 2n$$$.",
