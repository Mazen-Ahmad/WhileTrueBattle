  "statement": "Polycarp was given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. He really likes triples of numbers, so for each $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j \\le n - 2$$$) he wrote down a triple of elements $$$[a_j, a_{j + 1}, a_{j + 2}]$$$. Polycarp considers a pair of triples $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ beautiful if they differ in exactly one position, that is, one of the following conditions is satisfied: $$$b_1 \\ne c_1$$$ and $$$b_2 = c_2$$$ and $$$b_3 = c_3$$$; $$$b_1 = c_1$$$ and $$$b_2 \\ne c_2$$$ and $$$b_3 = c_3$$$; $$$b_1 = c_1$$$ and $$$b_2 = c_2$$$ and $$$b_3 \\ne c_3$$$. Find the number of beautiful pairs of triples among the written triples $$$[a_j, a_{j + 1}, a_{j + 2}]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ for all test cases in the test does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs of triples among the pairs of the form $$$[a_j, a_{j + 1}, a_{j + 2}]$$$. Note that the answer may not fit into 32-bit data types.",
