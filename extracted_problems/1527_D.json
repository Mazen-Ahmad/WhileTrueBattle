  "statement": "You are given a tree with $$$n$$$ nodes, numerated from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. For each $$$k$$$ between $$$0$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive, you have to count the number of unordered pairs $$$(u,v)$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$, such that the MEX of all the node labels in the shortest path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ (including end points) is $$$k$$$. The MEX of a sequence of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the sequence.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$). The next $$$n-1$$$ lines of each test case describe the tree that has to be constructed. These lines contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$0 \\le u,v \\le n-1$$$) denoting an edge between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$u \\neq v$$$). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$n+1$$$ integers: the number of paths in the tree, such that the MEX of all the node labels in that path is $$$k$$$ for each $$$k$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$.",
