  "statement": "A palindrome is a string that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example, abacaba , aaaa , abba , racecar are palindromes. You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The string $$$s$$$ is a palindrome. You have to check whether it is possible to rearrange the letters in it to get another palindrome (not equal to the given string $$$s$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$2 \\le |s| \\le 50$$$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. This string is a palindrome.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if it is possible to rearrange the letters in the given string to get another palindrome. Otherwise, print NO . You may print each letter in any case ( YES , yes , Yes will all be recognized as positive answer, NO , no and nO will all be recognized as negative answer).",
