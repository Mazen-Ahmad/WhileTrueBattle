  "statement": "For two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x,y\\ge 2$$$), we will say that $$$x$$$ is a generator of $$$y$$$ if and only if $$$x$$$ can be transformed to $$$y$$$ by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero): Choose a divisor $$$d$$$ ($$$d\\ge 2$$$) of $$$x$$$, then increase $$$x$$$ by $$$d$$$. For example, $$$3$$$ is a generator of $$$8$$$ since we can perform the following operations: $$$3 \\xrightarrow{d = 3} 6 \\xrightarrow{d = 2} 8$$$; $$$4$$$ is a generator of $$$10$$$ since we can perform the following operations: $$$4 \\xrightarrow{d = 4} 8 \\xrightarrow{d = 2} 10$$$; $$$5$$$ is not a generator of $$$6$$$ since we cannot transform $$$5$$$ into $$$6$$$ with the operation above. Now, Kevin gives you an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers ($$$a_i\\ge 2$$$). You have to find an integer $$$x\\ge 2$$$ such that for each $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$, $$$x$$$ is a generator of $$$a_i$$$, or determine that such an integer does not exist.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$2\\le a_i\\le 4\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the elements in the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the elements are pairwise distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer $$$x$$$ — the integer you found. Print $$$-1$$$ if there does not exist a valid $$$x$$$. If there are multiple answers, you may output any of them.",
