  "statement": "You are given an array of integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation zero or more times: In one operation choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$), assign $$$a_i := a_i + 1$$$, and then move $$$a_i$$$ to the back of the array (to the rightmost position). For example, if $$$a = [3, 5, 1, 9]$$$, and you choose $$$i = 2$$$, the array becomes $$$[3, 1, 9, 6]$$$. Find the lexicographically smallest$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ array you can get by performing these operations. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$c$$$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $$$d$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$c$$$ is a prefix of $$$d$$$, but $$$c \\ne d$$$; or in the first position where $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ differ, the array $$$c$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$d$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$), the length of the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$), the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
