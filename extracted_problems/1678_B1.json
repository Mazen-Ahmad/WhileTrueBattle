  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is that the harder version asks additionally for a minimum number of subsegments. Tokitsukaze has a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of zeros and ones, $$$n$$$ is even . Now Tokitsukaze divides $$$s$$$ into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same. After that, $$$s$$$ is considered good if the lengths of all subsegments are even. For example, if $$$s$$$ is \" 11001111 \", it will be divided into \" 11 \", \" 00 \" and \" 1111 \". Their lengths are $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ respectively, which are all even numbers, so \" 11001111 \" is good. Another example, if $$$s$$$ is \" 1110011000 \", it will be divided into \" 111 \", \" 00 \", \" 11 \" and \" 000 \", and their lengths are $$$3$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$. Obviously, \" 1110011000 \" is not good. Tokitsukaze wants to make $$$s$$$ good by changing the values of some positions in $$$s$$$. Specifically, she can perform the operation any number of times: change the value of $$$s_i$$$ to ' 0 ' or ' 1 '($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$). Can you tell her the minimum number of operations to make $$$s$$$ good?",
  "inputFormat": "The first contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$s$$$, it is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is even. The second line contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of zeros and ones. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line with one integer — the minimum number of operations to make $$$s$$$ good.",
