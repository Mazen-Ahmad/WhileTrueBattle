  "statement": "You are given a binary string$$$^{\\dagger}$$$. Please find the minimum number of pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. Note that: each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$ A binary string is a string consisting of characters $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$. A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all characters $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ come before all characters $$$\\texttt{1}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq |s| \\leq 500$$$) consisting of characters $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ denotes the length of the string $$$s$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.",
