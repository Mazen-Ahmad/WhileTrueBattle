  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, $$$n\\le 4\\cdot 10^5$$$. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. Serval has a magic number $$$k$$$ ($$$k\\ge 2$$$). We call an array $$$r$$$ colorful if and only if: The length of $$$r$$$ is $$$k$$$, and Each integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$ appears exactly once in $$$r$$$. You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$. It is guaranteed that each integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$ appears in $$$a$$$ at least once. You can perform the following operation on $$$a$$$: Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i < n$$$), then swap $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$. Find the minimum number of operations needed to make at least one subarray$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$a$$$ colorful . It can be shown that this is always possible under the constraints of the problem. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$b$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2\\leq k\\leq n\\leq 4\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and Serval's magic number. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq k$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that each integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$ appears in $$$a$$$ at least once. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make at least one subarray of $$$a$$$ colorful .",
