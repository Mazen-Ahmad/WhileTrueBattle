  "statement": "Annie has gotten bored of winning every coding contest and farming unlimited rating. Today, she is going to farm potatoes instead. Annie's garden is an infinite 2D plane. She has $$$n$$$ potatoes to plant, and the $$$i$$$-th potato must be planted at $$$(x_i,y_i)$$$. Starting at the point $$$(0, 0)$$$, Annie begins walking, in one step she can travel one unit right or up (increasing her $$$x$$$ or $$$y$$$ coordinate by $$$1$$$ respectively). At any point $$$(X,Y)$$$ during her walk she can plant some potatoes at arbitrary points using her potato gun, consuming $$$\\max(|X-x|,|Y-y|)$$$ units of energy in order to plant a potato at $$$(x,y)$$$. Find the minimum total energy required to plant every potato. Note that Annie may plant any number of potatoes from any point.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 800\\,000$$$). The next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le x_i,y_i \\le 10^9$$$), representing the location of the $$$i$$$-th potato. It is possible that some potatoes should be planted in the same location.",
  "outputFormat": "Print the minimum total energy to plant all potatoes.",
