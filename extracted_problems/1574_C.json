  "statement": "Recently, Petya learned about a new game \"Slay the Dragon\". As the name suggests, the player will have to fight with dragons. To defeat a dragon, you have to kill it and defend your castle. To do this, the player has a squad of $$$n$$$ heroes, the strength of the $$$i$$$-th hero is equal to $$$a_i$$$. According to the rules of the game, exactly one hero should go kill the dragon, all the others will defend the castle. If the dragon's defense is equal to $$$x$$$, then you have to send a hero with a strength of at least $$$x$$$ to kill it. If the dragon's attack power is $$$y$$$, then the total strength of the heroes defending the castle should be at least $$$y$$$. The player can increase the strength of any hero by $$$1$$$ for one gold coin. This operation can be done any number of times. There are $$$m$$$ dragons in the game, the $$$i$$$-th of them has defense equal to $$$x_i$$$ and attack power equal to $$$y_i$$$. Petya was wondering what is the minimum number of coins he needs to spend to defeat the $$$i$$$-th dragon. Note that the task is solved independently for each dragon (improvements are not saved).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — number of heroes. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{12}$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the strength of the $$$i$$$-th hero. The third line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of dragons. The next $$$m$$$ lines contain two integers each, $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le 10^{12}; 1 \\le y_i \\le 10^{18}$$$) — defense and attack power of the $$$i$$$-th dragon.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$m$$$ lines, $$$i$$$-th of which contains a single integer — the minimum number of coins that should be spent to defeat the $$$i$$$-th dragon.",
