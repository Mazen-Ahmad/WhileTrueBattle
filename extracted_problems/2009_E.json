  "statement": "Klee has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ containing integers $$$[k, k+1, ..., k+n-1]$$$ in that order. Klee wants to choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) such that $$$x = |a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_i - a_{i+1} - \\dots - a_n|$$$ is minimized. Note that for an arbitrary integer $$$z$$$, $$$|z|$$$ represents the absolute value of $$$z$$$. Output the minimum possible value of $$$x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n, k \\leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the starting element of the array.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum value of $$$x$$$ on a new line.",
