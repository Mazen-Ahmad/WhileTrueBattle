  "statement": "You are given a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of size $$$n$$$, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once . You can do the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): Choose any three indices $$$i, j, k$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < j < k \\le n$$$). If $$$a_i > a_k$$$, replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_i + a_j$$$. Otherwise, swap $$$a_j$$$ and $$$a_k$$$. Determine whether you can make the array $$$a$$$ sorted in non-descending order.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$, $$$a_i \\neq a_j$$$ if $$$i \\neq j$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" Yes \" (without quotes) if the array can be sorted in non-descending order, and \" No \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output \" Yes \" and \" No \" in any case (for example, strings \" YES \", \" yEs \" and \" yes \" will be recognized as a positive response).",
