  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. For every integer $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, you have to do the following: choose an arbitrary element of $$$a$$$ and move it to the right end of the array (you can choose the last element, then the array won't change); print the sum of $$$k$$$ last elements of $$$a$$$; move the element you've chosen on the first step to its original position (restore the original array $$$a$$$). For every $$$k$$$, you choose the element which you move so that the value you print is the maximum possible . Calculate the value you print for every $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$); the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of these integers should be equal to the maximum value you can print if $$$k=i$$$.",
