  "statement": "Given the string $$$s$$$ of decimal digits ( 0 - 9 ) of length $$$n$$$. A substring is a sequence of consecutive characters of a string. The substring of this string is defined by a pair of indexes — with its left and right ends. So, each pair of indexes ($$$l, r$$$), where $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, corresponds to a substring of the string $$$s$$$. We will define as $$$v(l,r)$$$ the numeric value of the corresponding substring (leading zeros are allowed in it). For example, if $$$n=7$$$, $$$s=$$$\" 1003004 \", then $$$v(1,3)=100$$$, $$$v(2,3)=0$$$ and $$$v(2,7)=3004$$$. You are given $$$n$$$, $$$s$$$ and an integer $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\le w < n$$$). You need to process $$$m$$$ queries, each of which is characterized by $$$3$$$ numbers $$$l_i, r_i, k_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n; 0 \\le k_i \\le 8$$$). The answer to the $$$i$$$th query is such a pair of substrings of length $$$w$$$ that if we denote them as $$$(L_1, L_1+w-1)$$$ and $$$(L_2, L_2+w-1)$$$, then: $$$L_1 \\ne L_2$$$, that is, the substrings are different; the remainder of dividing a number $$$v(L_1, L_1+w-1) \\cdot v(l_i, r_i) + v(L_2, L_2 + w - 1)$$$ by $$$9$$$ is equal to $$$k_i$$$. If there are many matching substring pairs, then find a pair where $$$L_1$$$ is as small as possible. If there are many matching pairs in this case, then minimize $$$L_2$$$. Note that the answer may not exist.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — number of input test cases. The first line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$, which contains only the characters 0 - 9 and has a length $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains two integers $$$w, m$$$ ($$$1 \\le w < n, 1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$n$$$ — is the length of the given string $$$s$$$. The number $$$w$$$ denotes the lengths of the substrings being searched for, and $$$m$$$ is the number of queries to be processed. The following $$$m$$$ lines contain integers $$$l_i, r_i, k_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$, $$$0 \\le k_i \\le 8$$$) — $$$i$$$th query parameters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each request, print in a separate line: left borders of the required substrings: $$$L_1$$$ and $$$L_2$$$; -1 -1 otherwise, if there is no solution. If there are several solutions, minimize $$$L_1$$$ first, and minimize $$$L_2$$$ second.",
