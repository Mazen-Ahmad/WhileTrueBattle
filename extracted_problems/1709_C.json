  "statement": "A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters \" ( \" and \" ) \". A regular bracket sequence (or, shortly, an RBS) is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \" 1 \" and \" + \" between the original characters of the sequence. For example: bracket sequences \" ()() \" and \" (()) \" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \" (1)+(1) \" and \" ((1+1)+1) \"); bracket sequences \" )( \", \" ( \" and \" ) \" are not. There was an RBS. Some brackets have been replaced with question marks. Is it true that there is a unique way to replace question marks with brackets, so that the resulting sequence is an RBS?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the number of testcases. The only line of each testcase contains an RBS with some brackets replaced with question marks. Each character is either ' ( ', ' ) ' or ' ? '. At least one RBS can be recovered from the given sequence. The total length of the sequences over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print \" YES \" if the way to replace question marks with brackets, so that the resulting sequence is an RBS, is unique . If there is more than one way, then print \" NO \".",
