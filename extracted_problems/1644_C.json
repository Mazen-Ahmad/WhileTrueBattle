  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You are also given an integer value $$$x$$$. Let $$$f(k)$$$ be the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of $$$a$$$ after applying the following operation: add $$$x$$$ to the elements on exactly $$$k$$$ distinct positions. An empty subarray should also be considered, it has sum $$$0$$$. Note that the subarray doesn't have to include all of the increased elements. Calculate the maximum value of $$$f(k)$$$ for all $$$k$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$ independently.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of the testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5000$$$; $$$0 \\le x \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array and the value to add. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print $$$n + 1$$$ integers — the maximum value of $$$f(k)$$$ for all $$$k$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$ independently.",
