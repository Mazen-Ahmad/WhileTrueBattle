  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n$$$. You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries, each consisting of two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. Consider the subarray $$$a[l:r]$$$ $$$=$$$ $$$[a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r]$$$. You can apply the following operation to the subarray any number of times (possibly zero)- Choose two integers $$$L$$$, $$$R$$$ such that $$$l \\le L \\le R \\le r$$$ and $$$R - L + 1$$$ is odd . Replace each element in the subarray from $$$L$$$ to $$$R$$$ with the XOR of the elements in the subarray $$$[L, R]$$$. The answer to the query is the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the subarray $$$a[l:r]$$$ equal to $$$0$$$ or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to make all of them equal to $$$0$$$. You can find more details about XOR operation here .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ $$$(1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$$$ — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(0 \\le a_i \\lt 2^{30})$$$ — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ $$$(1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n)$$$ — the description of the $$$i$$$-th query.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, output a single integer — the answer to that query.",
