  "statement": "You are at your grandparents' house and you are playing an old video game on a strange console. Your controller has only two buttons and each button has a number written on it. Initially, your score is $$$0$$$. The game is composed of $$$n$$$ rounds. For each $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th round works as follows. On the screen, a symbol $$$s_i$$$ appears, which is either $$$\\texttt{+}$$$ ( plus ) or $$$\\texttt{-}$$$ ( minus ). Then you must press one of the two buttons on the controller once . Suppose you press a button with the number $$$x$$$ written on it: your score will increase by $$$x$$$ if the symbol was $$$\\texttt{+}$$$ and will decrease by $$$x$$$ if the symbol was $$$\\texttt{-}$$$. After you press the button, the round ends. After you have played all $$$n$$$ rounds, you win if your score is $$$0$$$. Over the years, your grandparents bought many different controllers, so you have $$$q$$$ of them. The two buttons on the $$$j$$$-th controller have the numbers $$$a_j$$$ and $$$b_j$$$ written on them. For each controller, you must compute whether you can win the game playing with that controller.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rounds. The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ — where $$$s_i$$$ is the symbol that will appear on the screen in the $$$i$$$-th round. It is guaranteed that $$$s$$$ contains only the characters $$$\\texttt{+}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{-}$$$. The third line contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of controllers. The following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$a_j$$$ and $$$b_j$$$ each ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le 10^9$$$) — the numbers on the buttons of controller $$$j$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$q$$$ lines. On line $$$j$$$ print $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if the game is winnable using controller $$$j$$$, otherwise print $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$.",
