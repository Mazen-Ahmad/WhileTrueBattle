  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. For any real number $$$t$$$, consider the complete weighted graph on $$$n$$$ vertices $$$K_n(t)$$$ with weight of the edge between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ equal to $$$w_{ij}(t) = a_i \\cdot a_j + t \\cdot (a_i + a_j)$$$. Let $$$f(t)$$$ be the cost of the minimum spanning tree of $$$K_n(t)$$$. Determine whether $$$f(t)$$$ is bounded above and, if so, output the maximum value it attains.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices of the graph. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^6$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases is at most $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line with the maximum value of $$$f(t)$$$ (it can be shown that it is an integer), or INF if $$$f(t)$$$ is not bounded above.",
