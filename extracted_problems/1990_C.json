  "statement": "We define the $$$\\operatorname{MAD}$$$ (Maximum Appearing Duplicate) in an array as the largest number that appears at least twice in the array. Specifically, if there is no number that appears at least twice, the $$$\\operatorname{MAD}$$$ value is $$$0$$$. For example, $$$\\operatorname{MAD}([1, 2, 1]) = 1$$$, $$$\\operatorname{MAD}([2, 2, 3, 3]) = 3$$$, $$$\\operatorname{MAD}([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 0$$$. You are given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Initially, a variable $$$sum$$$ is set to $$$0$$$. The following process will be executed in a sequential loop until all numbers in $$$a$$$ become $$$0$$$: Set $$$sum := sum + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i$$$; Let $$$b$$$ be an array of size $$$n$$$. Set $$$b_i :=\\ \\operatorname{MAD}([a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_i])$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, and then set $$$a_i := b_i$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. Find the value of $$$sum$$$ after the process.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. For each test case: The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$; The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
