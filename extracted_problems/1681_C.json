  "statement": "You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. In one move, you can choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$; $$$i \\neq j$$$) and swap $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_j$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ with $$$b_j$$$. You have to perform the swap in both arrays. You are allowed to perform at most $$$10^4$$$ moves (possibly, zero). Can you make both arrays sorted in a non-decreasing order at the end? If you can, print any sequence of moves that makes both arrays sorted.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of elements in both arrays. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the first array. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le n$$$) — the second array.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print the answer. If it's impossible to make both arrays sorted in a non-decreasing order in at most $$$10^4$$$ moves, print -1 . Otherwise, first, print the number of moves $$$k$$$ $$$(0 \\le k \\le 10^4)$$$. Then print $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ for each move $$$(1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$; $$$i \\neq j)$$$. If there are multiple answers, then print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of moves.",
