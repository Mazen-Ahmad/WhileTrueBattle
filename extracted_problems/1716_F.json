  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ bags, each bag contains $$$m$$$ balls with numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. For every $$$i \\in [1, m]$$$, there is exactly one ball with number $$$i$$$ in each bag. You have to take exactly one ball from each bag (all bags are different, so, for example, taking the ball $$$1$$$ from the first bag and the ball $$$2$$$ from the second bag is not the same as taking the ball $$$2$$$ from the first bag and the ball $$$1$$$ from the second bag). After that, you calculate the number of balls with odd numbers among the ones you have taken. Let the number of these balls be $$$F$$$. Your task is to calculate the sum of $$$F^k$$$ over all possible ways to take $$$n$$$ balls, one from each bag.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 998244352$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 2000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the sum of $$$F^k$$$ over all possible ways to take $$$n$$$ balls, one from each bag. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
