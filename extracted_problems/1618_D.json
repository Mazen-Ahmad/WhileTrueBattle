  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, and another integer $$$k$$$ such that $$$2k \\le n$$$. You have to perform exactly $$$k$$$ operations with this array. In one operation, you have to choose two elements of the array (let them be $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$; they can be equal or different, but their positions in the array must not be the same ), remove them from the array, and add $$$\\lfloor \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\rfloor$$$ to your score , where $$$\\lfloor \\frac{x}{y} \\rfloor$$$ is the maximum integer not exceeding $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. Initially, your score is $$$0$$$. After you perform exactly $$$k$$$ operations, you add all the remaining elements of the array to the score . Calculate the minimum possible score you can get.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).",
