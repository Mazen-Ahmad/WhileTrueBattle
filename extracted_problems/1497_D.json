  "statement": "Please note the non-standard memory limit. There are $$$n$$$ problems numbered with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. $$$i$$$-th problem has the complexity $$$c_i = 2^i$$$, tag $$$tag_i$$$ and score $$$s_i$$$. After solving the problem $$$i$$$ it's allowed to solve problem $$$j$$$ if and only if $$$\\text{IQ} < |c_i - c_j|$$$ and $$$tag_i \\neq tag_j$$$. After solving it your $$$\\text{IQ}$$$ changes and becomes $$$\\text{IQ} = |c_i - c_j|$$$ and you gain $$$|s_i - s_j|$$$ points. Any problem can be the first. You can solve problems in any order and as many times as you want. Initially your $$$\\text{IQ} = 0$$$. Find the maximum number of points that can be earned.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\le t \\le 100)$$$ — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\le n \\le 5000)$$$ — the number of problems. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$tag_1, tag_2, \\ldots, tag_n$$$ $$$(1 \\le tag_i \\le n)$$$ — tags of the problems. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$ $$$(1 \\le s_i \\le 10^9)$$$ — scores of the problems. It's guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
