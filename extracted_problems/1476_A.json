  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. You should create an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ such that the sum $$$(a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_n)$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$ and maximum element in $$$a$$$ is minimum possible. What is the minimum possible maximum element in $$$a$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible maximum element in array $$$a$$$ such that the sum $$$(a_1 + \\dots + a_n)$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$.",
