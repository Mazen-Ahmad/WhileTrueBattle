  "statement": "Ecrade has an integer $$$x$$$. He will show you this number in the form of a binary number of length $$$n$$$. There are two kinds of operations. Replace $$$x$$$ with $$$\\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$$ is the greatest integer $$$\\le \\dfrac{x}{2}$$$. Replace $$$x$$$ with $$$\\left\\lceil \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rceil$$$, where $$$\\left\\lceil \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rceil$$$ is the smallest integer $$$\\ge \\dfrac{x}{2}$$$. Ecrade will perform several operations until $$$x$$$ becomes $$$1$$$. Each time, he will independently choose to perform either the first operation or the second operation with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$. Ecrade wants to know the expected number of operations he will perform to make $$$x$$$ equal to $$$1$$$, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$x$$$ in binary representation. The second line of each test case contains a binary string of length $$$n$$$: the number $$$x$$$ in the binary representation, presented from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. It is guaranteed that the most significant bit of $$$x$$$ is $$$1$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer representing the expected number of operations Ecrade will perform to make $$$x$$$ equal to $$$1$$$, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. Formally, let $$$M = 10^9+7$$$. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.",
