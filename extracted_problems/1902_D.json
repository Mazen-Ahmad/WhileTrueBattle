  "statement": "There is an infinite $$$2$$$-dimensional grid. Initially, a robot stands in the point $$$(0, 0)$$$. The robot can execute four commands: U — move from point $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x, y + 1)$$$; D — move from point $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x, y - 1)$$$; L — move from point $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x - 1, y)$$$; R — move from point $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(x + 1, y)$$$. You are given a sequence of commands $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Your task is to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries: given four integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$; determine whether the robot visits the point $$$(x, y)$$$, while executing a sequence $$$s$$$, but the substring from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is reversed (i. e. the robot performs commands in order $$$s_1 s_2 s_3 \\dots s_{l-1} s_r s_{r-1} s_{r-2} \\dots s_l s_{r+1} s_{r+2} \\dots s_n$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the command sequence and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters U , D , L and/or R . Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains four integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$, $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$-n \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$; $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) describing the $$$i$$$-th query.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print YES if the robot visits the point $$$(x, y)$$$, while executing a sequence $$$s$$$, but the substring from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is reversed; otherwise print NO .",
