  "statement": "You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Calculate the number of subarrays of this array $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$, such that: The array $$$b = [a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r]$$$ occurs in the array $$$a$$$ as a subsequence exactly once. In other words, there is exactly one way to select a set of indices $$$1 \\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_{r - l + 1} \\leq n$$$, such that $$$b_j = a_{i_j}$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq j \\leq r - l + 1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by their description. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
