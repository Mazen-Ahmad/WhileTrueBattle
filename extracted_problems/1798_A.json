  "statement": "You are given two arrays $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$. In one operation, you can choose any integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and swap the numbers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. Determine whether, after using any (possibly zero) number of operations, the following two conditions can be satisfied simultaneously: $$$a_n = \\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$$$, $$$b_n = \\max(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n)$$$. Here $$$\\max(c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k)$$$ denotes the maximum number among $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$$$. For example, $$$\\max(3, 5, 4) = 5$$$, $$$\\max(1, 7, 7) = 7$$$, $$$\\max(6, 2) = 6$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 200$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the arrays. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$) — elements of the first array. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 100$$$) — elements of the second array.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" Yes \" if after using any (possibly zero) number of operations the conditions described above are satisfied. Otherwise, print \" No \". You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \", and \" YES \" will be recognized as positive responses.",
