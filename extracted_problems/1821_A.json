  "statement": "An integer template is a string consisting of digits and/or question marks. A positive (strictly greater than $$$0$$$) integer matches the integer template if it is possible to replace every question mark in the template with a digit in such a way that we get the decimal representation of that integer without any leading zeroes . For example: $$$42$$$ matches 4? ; $$$1337$$$ matches ???? ; $$$1337$$$ matches 1?3? ; $$$1337$$$ matches 1337 ; $$$3$$$ does not match ?? ; $$$8$$$ does not match ???8 ; $$$1337$$$ does not match 1?7 . You are given an integer template consisting of at most $$$5$$$ characters . Calculate the number of positive (strictly greater than $$$0$$$) integers that match it.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 5$$$) consisting of digits and/or question marks — the integer template for the corresponding test case.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the number of positive (strictly greater than $$$0$$$) integers that match the template.",
