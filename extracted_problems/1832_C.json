  "statement": "For an array of integers $$$[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$$$, let's call the value $$$|a_1-a_2|+|a_2-a_3|+\\cdots+|a_{n-1}-a_n|$$$ the contrast of the array. Note that the contrast of an array of size $$$1$$$ is equal to $$$0$$$. You are given an array of integers $$$a$$$. Your task is to build an array of $$$b$$$ in such a way that all the following conditions are met: $$$b$$$ is not empty, i.e there is at least one element; $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of $$$a$$$, i.e $$$b$$$ can be produced by deleting some elements from $$$a$$$ (maybe zero); the contrast of $$$b$$$ is equal to the contrast of $$$a$$$. What is the minimum possible size of the array $$$b$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\cdot, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array itself. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
