  "statement": "There's a chip in the point $$$(0, 0)$$$ of the coordinate plane. In one operation, you can move the chip from some point $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to some point $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ if the Euclidean distance between these two points is an integer (i.e. $$$\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}$$$ is integer). Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to move the chip from the point $$$(0, 0)$$$ to the point $$$(x, y)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 3000$$$) — number of test cases. The single line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$0 \\le x, y \\le 50$$$) — the coordinates of the destination point.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to move the chip from the point $$$(0, 0)$$$ to the point $$$(x, y)$$$.",
