  "statement": "Given a sequence of positive integers, a positive integer is called a mode of the sequence if it occurs the maximum number of times that any positive integer occurs. For example, the mode of $$$[2,2,3]$$$ is $$$2$$$. Any of $$$9$$$, $$$8$$$, or $$$7$$$ can be considered to be a mode of the sequence $$$[9,9,8,8,7,7]$$$. You gave UFO an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. To thank you, UFO decides to construct another array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$a_i$$$ is a mode of the sequence $$$[b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_i]$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. However, UFO doesn't know how to construct array $$$b$$$, so you must help her. Note that $$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq n$$$ must hold for your array for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The following line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ numbers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq n$$$) on a new line. It can be shown that $$$b$$$ can always be constructed. If there are multiple possible arrays, you may print any.",
