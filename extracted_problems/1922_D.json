  "statement": "Monocarp is playing a computer game (yet again). Guess what is he doing? That's right, killing monsters. There are $$$n$$$ monsters in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th monster has two parameters: attack value equal to $$$a_i$$$ and defense value equal to $$$d_i$$$. In order to kill these monsters, Monocarp put a berserk spell on them, so they're attacking each other instead of Monocarp's character. The fight consists of $$$n$$$ rounds. Every round, the following happens: first, every alive monster $$$i$$$ deals $$$a_i$$$ damage to the closest alive monster to the left (if it exists) and the closest alive monster to the right (if it exists); then, every alive monster $$$j$$$ which received more than $$$d_j$$$ damage during this round dies. I. e. the $$$j$$$-th monster dies if and only if its defense value $$$d_j$$$ is strictly less than the total damage it received this round . For each round, calculate the number of monsters that will die during that round.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$); the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$); the third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le d_i \\le 10^9$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be equal to the number of monsters that die during the $$$i$$$-th round.",
