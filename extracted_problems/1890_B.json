  "statement": "Qingshan has a string $$$s$$$, while Daniel has a string $$$t$$$. Both strings only contain $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$. A string $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ is good if and only if $$$a_i \\ne a_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$i=1,2,\\ldots,k-1$$$. For example, $$$\\texttt{1}$$$, $$$\\texttt{101}$$$, $$$\\texttt{0101}$$$ are good, while $$$\\texttt{11}$$$, $$$\\texttt{1001}$$$, $$$\\texttt{001100}$$$ are not good. Qingshan wants to make $$$s$$$ good. To do this, she can do the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): insert $$$t$$$ to any position of $$$s$$$ (getting a new $$$s$$$). Please tell Qingshan if it is possible to make $$$s$$$ good.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1\\le T\\le 2000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n,m \\le 50$$$) — the length of the strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, respectively. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The third line of each test case contains a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ only contain $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" YES \" (without quotes), if it is possible to make $$$s$$$ good, and \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print letters in any case (upper or lower).",
