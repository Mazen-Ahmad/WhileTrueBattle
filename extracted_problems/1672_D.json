  "statement": "There is an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You may perform the following operation any number of times: Choose two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ where $$$1 \\le l < r \\le n$$$ and $$$a_l = a_r$$$. Then, set $$$a[l \\ldots r] = [a_{l+1}, a_{l+2}, \\ldots, a_r, a_l]$$$. You are also given another array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ which is a permutation of $$$a$$$. Determine whether it is possible to transform array $$$a$$$ into an array $$$b$$$ using the above operation some number of times.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le n$$$) — elements of the array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$b$$$ is a permutation of $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" YES \" (without quotes) if it is possible to transform array $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$, and \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output \" YES \" and \" NO \" in any case (for example, strings \" yEs \", \" yes \" and \" Yes \" will be recognized as a positive response).",
