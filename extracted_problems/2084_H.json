  "statement": "LGR-205-Div.1 C Turtle and Nediam You are given a binary sequence $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ which only consists of $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. You can do the following operation at most $$$n - 2$$$ times (possibly zero): Let $$$m$$$ denote the current length of $$$s$$$. Choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i \\le m - 2$$$. Let the median$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of the subarray $$$[s_i, s_{i + 1}, s_{i + 2}]$$$ be $$$x$$$, and let $$$j$$$ be the smallest integer such that $$$j \\ge i$$$ and $$$s_j = x$$$. Remove $$$s_j$$$ from the sequence and concatenate the remaining parts. In other words, replace $$$s$$$ with $$$[s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{j - 1}, s_{j + 1}, s_{j + 2}, \\ldots, s_m]$$$. Note that after every operation, the length of $$$s$$$ decreases by $$$1$$$. Find how many different binary sequences can be obtained after performing the operation, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The median of an array of odd length $$$k$$$ is the $$$\\frac{k + 1}{2}$$$-th element when sorted.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^6$$$) — the length of the binary sequence. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of binary sequences that can be obtained, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
