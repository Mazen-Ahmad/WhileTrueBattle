  "statement": "There is a sheet of paper that can be represented with a grid of size $$$n \\times m$$$: $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns of cells. All cells are colored in white initially. $$$q$$$ operations have been applied to the sheet. The $$$i$$$-th of them can be described as follows: $$$x_i$$$ $$$y_i$$$ — choose one of $$$k$$$ non-white colors and color the entire row $$$x_i$$$ and the entire column $$$y_i$$$ in it. The new color is applied to each cell, regardless of whether the cell was colored before the operation. The sheet after applying all $$$q$$$ operations is called a coloring. Two colorings are different if there exists at least one cell that is colored in different colors. How many different colorings are there? Print the number modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of the testcase contains four integers $$$n, m, k$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m, k, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the sheet, the number of non-white colors and the number of operations. The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains a description of the $$$i$$$-th operation — two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le n$$$; $$$1 \\le y_i \\le m$$$) — the row and the column the operation is applied to. The sum of $$$q$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print a single integer — the number of different colorings modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
