  "statement": "The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. His favorite nephew has another binary string $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ ($$$m \\leq n$$$). Mr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer $$$k$$$. His nephew wants exactly $$$k$$$ occurrences of $$$b$$$ as substrings in $$$a$$$. However, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of $$$k$$$. So, for each $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\leq k \\leq n - m + 1$$$), find the minimum number of elements in $$$a$$$ that have to be changed such that there are exactly $$$k$$$ occurrences of $$$b$$$ in $$$a$$$. A string $$$s$$$ occurs exactly $$$k$$$ times in $$$t$$$ if there are exactly $$$k$$$ different pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ such that we can obtain $$$s$$$ by deleting $$$p$$$ characters from the beginning and $$$q$$$ characters from the end of $$$t$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq n \\leq 500$$$) — size of the binary string $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ respectively. The second line contains a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The third line contains a binary string $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$n - m + 2$$$ integers — the $$$(k+1)$$$-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in $$$a$$$ that have to be changed so there are exactly $$$k$$$ occurrences of $$$b$$$ as a substring in $$$a$$$.",
