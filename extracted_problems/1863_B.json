  "statement": "You are given a permutation$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ of integers $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You can change the current permutation by applying the following operation several (possibly, zero) times: choose some $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \\le x \\le n$$$); create a new permutation by: first, writing down all elements of $$$p$$$ that are less than $$$x$$$, without changing their order; second, writing down all elements of $$$p$$$ that are greater than or equal to $$$x$$$, without changing their order; replace $$$p$$$ with the newly created permutation. For example, if the permutation used to be $$$[6, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1]$$$ and you choose $$$x = 4$$$, then you will first write down $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$, then append this with $$$[6, 4, 5]$$$. So the initial permutation will be replaced by $$$[3, 2, 1, 6, 4, 5]$$$. Find the minimum number of operations you need to achieve $$$p_i = i$$$ for $$$i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. We can show that it is always possible to do so. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ is a permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100\\,000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the answer on a separate line.",
