  "statement": "Vittorio is playing with his new LEGO Duplo bricks. All the bricks have the shape of a square cuboid with a $$$2 \\times 2$$$ square base and a height of $$$1$$$. They can be arranged in the 3D space to build structures, provided that the following rules are met: No two bricks can intersect, but they can touch on their faces. The corners of every brick must have integer coordinates (so bricks are axis-aligned) and the $$$z$$$ coordinates of all corners must be non-negative. The square bases of every brick must be parallel to the ground (i.e. the plane $$$z=0$$$). The lower base of any brick that is not touching the ground must touch the upper base of some other brick in a region of positive area (when this happens, the two bricks stay attached to each other thanks to small studs). For example, this is a valid structure: Vittorio wants to build a structure that includes purple bricks in the following $$$n$$$ positions: $$$(x_1, 0, h)$$$, $$$(x_2, 0, h)$$$, $$$\\dots$$$, $$$(x_n, 0, h)$$$ — these are the coordinates of the centers of their lower bases; note that all of these bricks have $$$y$$$ coordinate equal to $$$0$$$ and $$$z$$$ coordinate equal to $$$h$$$. Vittorio will use additional bricks of other colors to support the purple bricks. He is willing to place bricks only in positions where the center of the lower base has $$$y$$$ coordinate equal to $$$0$$$. What is the minimum number of additional bricks needed? It can be shown that a valid construction always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$h$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 300$$$, $$$0 \\le h \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of purple bricks and their common $$$z$$$ coordinate. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, \\, x_2, \\, \\dots, \\, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le 10^9$$$, $$$x_i + 1 < x_{i+1}$$$) — the $$$x$$$ coordinates of the purple bricks (centers of the bases), given in increasing order.",
  "outputFormat": "Print the minimum number of additional bricks needed.",
