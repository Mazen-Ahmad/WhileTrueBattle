  "statement": "Allen has an array $$$a_1, a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$. For every positive integer $$$k$$$ that is a divisor of $$$n$$$, Allen does the following: He partitions the array into $$$\\frac{n}{k}$$$ disjoint subarrays of length $$$k$$$. In other words, he partitions the array into the following subarrays: $$$$$$[a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_k],[a_{k+1}, a_{k+2},\\ldots,a_{2k}],\\ldots,[a_{n-k+1},a_{n-k+2},\\ldots,a_{n}]$$$$$$ Allen earns one point if there exists some positive integer $$$m$$$ ($$$m \\geq 2$$$) such that if he replaces every element in the array with its remainder when divided by $$$m$$$, then all subarrays will be identical. Help Allen find the number of points he will earn.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
