  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. In this version, $$$n \\le 3000$$$, $$$x \\ge y$$$ holds. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. You are given two binary strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. You can do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero). Select two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$l < r$$$). Change $$$a_l$$$ to $$$(1 - a_l)$$$, and $$$a_r$$$ to $$$(1 - a_r)$$$. If $$$l + 1 = r$$$, the cost of the operation is $$$x$$$. Otherwise, the cost is $$$y$$$. You have to find the minimum cost needed to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$ or say there is no way to do so.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 600$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$y$$$ ($$$5 \\le n \\le 3000$$$, $$$1 \\le y \\le x \\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the strings, and the costs per operation. The second line of each test case contains the string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The string only consists of digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. The third line of each test case contains the string $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The string only consists of digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no way to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$, print $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, print the minimum cost needed to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.",
