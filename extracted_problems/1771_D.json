  "statement": "Hossam has an unweighted tree $$$G$$$ with letters in vertices. Hossam defines $$$s(v, \\, u)$$$ as a string that is obtained by writing down all the letters on the unique simple path from the vertex $$$v$$$ to the vertex $$$u$$$ in the tree $$$G$$$. A string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$s$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero) letters. For example, \" dores \", \" cf \", and \" for \" are subsequences of \" codeforces \", while \" decor \" and \" fork \" are not. A palindrome is a string that reads the same from left to right and from right to left. For example, \" abacaba \" is a palindrome, but \" abac \" is not. Hossam defines a sub-palindrome of a string $$$s$$$ as a subsequence of $$$s$$$, that is a palindrome. For example, \" k \", \" abba \" and \" abhba \" are sub-palindromes of the string \" abhbka \", but \" abka \" and \" cat \" are not. Hossam defines a maximal sub-palindrome of a string $$$s$$$ as a sub-palindrome of $$$s$$$, which has the maximal length among all sub-palindromes of $$$s$$$. For example, \" abhbka \" has only one maximal sub-palindrome — \" abhba \". But it may also be that the string has several maximum sub-palindromes: the string \" abcd \" has $$$4$$$ maximum sub-palindromes. Help Hossam find the length of the longest maximal sub-palindrome among all $$$s(v, \\, u)$$$ in the tree $$$G$$$. Note that the sub-palindrome is a subsequence, not a substring.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 200$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case has one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^3$$$) — the number of vertices in the graph. The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th symbol of which denotes the letter on the vertex $$$i$$$. It is guaranteed that all characters in this string are lowercase English letters. The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines describe the edges of the tree. Each edge is given by two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\le v, \\, u \\le n$$$, $$$v \\neq u$$$). These two numbers mean that there is an edge $$$(v, \\, u)$$$ in the tree. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that sum of all $$$n$$$ doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^3$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output one integer — the length of the longest maximal sub-palindrome among all $$$s(v, \\, u)$$$.",
