  "statement": "Marian is at a casino. The game at the casino works like this. Before each round, the player selects a number between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$. After that, a dice with $$$10^9$$$ faces is rolled so that a random number between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$ appears. If the player guesses the number correctly their total money is doubled, else their total money is halved. Marian predicted the future and knows all the numbers $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$ that the dice will show in the next $$$n$$$ rounds. He will pick three integers $$$a$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$l \\leq r$$$). He will play $$$r-l+1$$$ rounds (rounds between $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ inclusive). In each of these rounds, he will guess the same number $$$a$$$. At the start (before the round $$$l$$$) he has $$$1$$$ dollar. Marian asks you to determine the integers $$$a$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$) such that he makes the most money at the end. Note that during halving and multiplying there is no rounding and there are no precision errors. So, for example during a game, Marian could have money equal to $$$\\dfrac{1}{1024}$$$, $$$\\dfrac{1}{128}$$$, $$$\\dfrac{1}{2}$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, etc. (any value of $$$2^t$$$, where $$$t$$$ is an integer of any sign).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of rounds. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq 10^9$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ is the number that will fall on the dice in the $$$i$$$-th round. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output three integers $$$a$$$, $$$l$$$, and $$$r$$$ such that Marian makes the most amount of money gambling with his strategy. If there are multiple answers, you may output any of them.",
