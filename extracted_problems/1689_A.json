  "statement": "Kuznecov likes art, poetry, and music. And strings consisting of lowercase English letters. Recently, Kuznecov has found two strings, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, of lengths $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ respectively. They consist of lowercase English letters and no character is contained in both strings . Let another string $$$c$$$ be initially empty. Kuznecov can do the following two types of operations: Choose any character from the string $$$a$$$, remove it from $$$a$$$, and add it to the end of $$$c$$$. Choose any character from the string $$$b$$$, remove it from $$$b$$$, and add it to the end of $$$c$$$. But, he can not do more than $$$k$$$ operations of the same type in a row. He must perform operations until either $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$ becomes empty. What is the lexicographically smallest possible value of $$$c$$$ after he finishes? A string $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$y$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$x$$$ is a prefix of $$$y$$$, but $$$x \\neq y$$$; in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, the string $$$x$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "There are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\leq n,m,k \\leq 100$$$) — parameters from the statement. The second line of each test case contains the string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The third line of each test case contains the string $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$. The strings contain only lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that no symbol appears in $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ simultaneously.",
  "outputFormat": "In each test case, output a single string $$$c$$$ — the answer to the problem.",
