  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. There is a hidden permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$. Consider an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ nodes only with no edges. You can make two types of queries: Specify an integer $$$x$$$ satisfying $$$2 \\le x \\le 2n$$$. For all integers $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) such that $$$1 \\le x-i \\le n$$$, an edge between node $$$i$$$ and node $$$x-i$$$ will be added. Query the number of edges in the shortest path between node $$$p_i$$$ and node $$$p_j$$$. As the answer to this question you will get the number of edges in the shortest path if such a path exists, or $$$-1$$$ if there is no such path. Note that you can make both types of queries in any order. Within $$$2n$$$ queries (including type $$$1$$$ and type $$$2$$$), guess two possible permutations, at least one of which is $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$. You get accepted if at least one of the permutations is correct. You are allowed to guess the same permutation twice. A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^3$$$) — the length of the permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^3$$$.",
