  "statement": "You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ (a string consisting only of 0 -s and 1 -s). You can perform two types of operations on $$$s$$$: delete one character from $$$s$$$. This operation costs $$$1$$$ coin; swap any pair of characters in $$$s$$$. This operation is free (costs $$$0$$$ coins). You can perform these operations any number of times and in any order. Let's name a string you've got after performing operations above as $$$t$$$. The string $$$t$$$ is good if for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$|t|$$$ $$$t_i \\neq s_i$$$ ($$$|t|$$$ is the length of the string $$$t$$$). The empty string is always good . Note that you are comparing the resulting string $$$t$$$ with the initial string $$$s$$$. What is the minimum total cost to make the string $$$t$$$ good?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$s_i \\in \\{$$$ 0 , 1 $$$\\}$$$) — the initial string, consisting of characters 0 and/or 1 . Additional constraint on the input: the total length of all strings $$$s$$$ doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum total cost to make string $$$t$$$ good.",
