  "statement": "Gianni, SWERC's chief judge, received a huge amount of high quality problems from the judges and now he has to choose a problem set for SWERC. He received $$$n$$$ problems and he assigned a beauty score and a difficulty to each of them. The $$$i$$$-th problem has beauty score equal to $$$b_i$$$ and difficulty equal to $$$d_i$$$. The beauty and the difficulty are integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$10$$$. If there are no problems with a certain difficulty (the possible difficulties are $$$1,2,\\dots,10$$$) then Gianni will ask for more problems to the judges. Otherwise, for each difficulty between $$$1$$$ and $$$10$$$, he will put in the problem set one of the most beautiful problems with such difficulty (so the problem set will contain exactly $$$10$$$ problems with distinct difficulties). You shall compute the total beauty of the problem set, that is the sum of the beauty scores of the problems chosen by Gianni.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 100$$$) — how many problems Gianni received from the judges. The next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers each. The $$$i$$$-th of such lines contains $$$b_i$$$ and $$$d_i$$$ ($$$1\\le b_i, d_i\\le 10$$$) — the beauty score and the difficulty of the $$$i$$$-th problem.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the total beauty of the problem set chosen by Gianni. If Gianni cannot create a problem set (because there are no problems with a certain difficulty) print the string MOREPROBLEMS (all letters are uppercase, there are no spaces).",
