  "statement": "Monocarp had a sequence $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n + m$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n + m}$$$. He painted the elements into two colors, red and blue; $$$n$$$ elements were painted red, all other $$$m$$$ elements were painted blue. After painting the elements, he has written two sequences $$$r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_m$$$. The sequence $$$r$$$ consisted of all red elements of $$$a$$$ in the order they appeared in $$$a$$$ ; similarly, the sequence $$$b$$$ consisted of all blue elements of $$$a$$$ in the order they appeared in $$$a$$$ as well . Unfortunately, the original sequence was lost, and Monocarp only has the sequences $$$r$$$ and $$$b$$$. He wants to restore the original sequence. In case there are multiple ways to restore it, he wants to choose a way to restore that maximizes the value of $$$$$$f(a) = \\max(0, a_1, (a_1 + a_2), (a_1 + a_2 + a_3), \\dots, (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\dots + a_{n + m}))$$$$$$ Help Monocarp to calculate the maximum possible value of $$$f(a)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n$$$ ($$$-100 \\le r_i \\le 100$$$). The third line contains one integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 100$$$). The fourth line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_m$$$ ($$$-100 \\le b_i \\le 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible value of $$$f(a)$$$.",
