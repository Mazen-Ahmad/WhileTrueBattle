  "statement": "This is an interactive task William has a certain sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ in his mind, but due to security concerns, he does not want to reveal it to you completely. William is ready to respond to no more than $$$2 \\cdot n$$$ of the following questions: What is the result of a bitwise AND of two items with indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \\neq j$$$) What is the result of a bitwise OR of two items with indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \\neq j$$$) You can ask William these questions and you need to find the $$$k$$$-th smallest number of the sequence. Formally the $$$k$$$-th smallest number is equal to the number at the $$$k$$$-th place in a 1-indexed array sorted in non-decreasing order. For example in array $$$[5, 3, 3, 10, 1]$$$ $$$4$$$th smallest number is equal to $$$5$$$, and $$$2$$$nd and $$$3$$$rd are $$$3$$$.",
