  "statement": "Given a natural number $$$x$$$. You can perform the following operation: choose a positive integer $$$k$$$ and round $$$x$$$ to the $$$k$$$-th digit Note that the positions are numbered from right to left, starting from zero. If the number has $$$k$$$ digits, it is considered that the digit at the $$$k$$$-th position is equal to $$$0$$$. The rounding is done as follows: if the digit at the $$$(k-1)$$$-th position is greater than or equal to $$$5$$$, then the digit at the $$$k$$$-th position is increased by $$$1$$$, otherwise the digit at the $$$k$$$-th position remains unchanged (mathematical rounding is used). if before the operations the digit at the $$$k$$$-th position was $$$9$$$, and it should be increased by $$$1$$$, then we search for the least position $$$k'$$$ ($$$k'>k$$$), where the digit at the $$$k'$$$-th position is less than $$$9$$$ and add $$$1$$$ to the digit at the $$$k'$$$-th position. Then we assign $$$k=k'$$$. after that, all digits which positions are less than $$$k$$$ are replaced with zeros. Your task is to make $$$x$$$ as large as possible, if you can perform the operation as many times as you want. For example, if $$$x$$$ is equal to $$$3451$$$, then if you choose consecutively: $$$k=1$$$, then after the operation $$$x$$$ will become $$$3450$$$ $$$k=2$$$, then after the operation $$$x$$$ will become $$$3500$$$ $$$k=3$$$, then after the operation $$$x$$$ will become $$$4000$$$ $$$k=4$$$, then after the operation $$$x$$$ will become $$$0$$$ To maximize the answer, you need to choose $$$k=2$$$ first, and then $$$k=3$$$, then the number will become $$$4000$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of positive integer $$$x$$$ with a length of up to $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that there are no leading zeros in the integer. It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of all integers $$$x$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each set of input data, output the maximum possible value of $$$x$$$ after the operations. The number should not have leading zeros in its representation.",
