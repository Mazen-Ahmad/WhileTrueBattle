  "statement": "The weight of a sequence is defined as the number of unordered pairs of indexes $$$(i,j)$$$ (here $$$i \\lt j$$$) with same value ($$$a_{i} = a_{j}$$$). For example, the weight of sequence $$$a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]$$$ is $$$4$$$. The set of unordered pairs of indexes with same value are $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 5)$$$, $$$(2, 5)$$$, and $$$(3, 4)$$$. You are given a sequence $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. Print the sum of the weight of all subsegments of $$$a$$$. A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsegment of a sequence $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer â€” the sum of the weight of all subsegments of $$$a$$$.",
