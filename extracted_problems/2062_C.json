  "statement": "Cirno has a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. She can perform either of the following two operations for any (possibly, zero) times unless the current length of $$$a$$$ is $$$1$$$: Reverse the sequence. Formally, $$$[a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n]$$$ becomes $$$[a_n,a_{n-1},\\ldots,a_1]$$$ after the operation. Replace the sequence with its difference sequence. Formally, $$$[a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n]$$$ becomes $$$[a_2-a_1,a_3-a_2,\\ldots,a_n-a_{n-1}]$$$ after the operation. Find the maximum possible sum of elements of $$$a$$$ after all operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of input test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 50$$$) — the length of sequence $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$|a_i|\\le 1000$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print an integer representing the maximum possible sum.",
