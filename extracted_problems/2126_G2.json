  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version $$$a_i \\leq n$$$. You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. Your task is to find a subarray $$$a[l, r]$$$ (a continuous sequence of elements $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\dots, a_r$$$) for which the value of the expression $$$\\text{med}(a[l, r]) - \\min(a[l, r])$$$ is maximized. Here: $$$\\text{med}$$$ is the median of the subarray, that is, the element at position $$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{k + 1}{2} \\right\\rceil$$$ after sorting the subarray, where $$$k$$$ is its length; $$$\\min$$$ is the minimum element of this subarray. For example, consider the array $$$a=[1, 4, 1, 5, 3, 3]$$$ and choose the subarray $$$a[2, 5] = [4, 1, 5, 3]$$$. In sorted form, it looks like $$$[1, 3, 4, 5]$$$. $$$\\text{med}(a[2, 5]) = 4$$$, since $$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{4 + 1}{2} \\right\\rceil = $$$ the third element in the sorted subarray is $$$4$$$; $$$\\min(a[2, 5]) = 1$$$, since the minimum element is $$$1$$$. In this example, the value $$$\\text{med} - \\min = 4 - 1 = 3$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the maximum possible value of $$$\\text{med} - \\min$$$ among all subarrays of the array.",
