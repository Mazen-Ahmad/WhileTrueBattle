  "statement": "On another boring day, Egor got bored and decided to do something. But since he has no friends, he came up with a game to play. Egor has a deck of $$$n$$$ cards, the $$$i$$$-th card from the top has a number $$$a_i$$$ written on it. Egor wants to play a certain number of rounds until the cards run out. In each round, he takes a non-zero number of cards from the top of the deck and finishes the round. If the sum of the numbers on the cards collected during the round is between $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, inclusive, the round is won; otherwise, it is lost. Egor knows by heart the order of the cards. Help Egor determine the maximum number of rounds he can win in such a game. Note that Egor is not required to win rounds consecutively.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$, and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{5}$$$, $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^9$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the numbers on the cards from top to bottom. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single number — the maximum number of rounds Egor can win.",
