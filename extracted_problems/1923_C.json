  "statement": "An array $$$a$$$ of length $$$m$$$ is considered good if there exists an integer array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ such that the following conditions hold: $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i$$$; $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$ for every index $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$; $$$b_i > 0$$$ for every index $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. You are given an array $$$c$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Each element of this array is greater than $$$0$$$. You have to answer $$$q$$$ queries. During the $$$i$$$-th query, you have to determine whether the subarray $$$c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \\dots, c_{r_{i}}$$$ is good.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$c$$$ and the number of queries. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le 10^9$$$). Then $$$q$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$) — the borders of the $$$i$$$-th subarray. Additional constraints on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$; the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO . You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings yEs , yes , Yes , and YES will all be recognized as positive responses.",
