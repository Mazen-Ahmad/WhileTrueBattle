  "statement": "Piotr Rubik - Psalm dla Ciebie ඞ There is an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$2^k$$$ for some positive integer $$$k$$$, which is initially a permutation of values from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^k$$$. Alice and Bob play the following game on the array $$$a$$$. First, a value $$$t$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$ is shown to both Alice and Bob. Then, for exactly $$$t$$$ turns, the following happens: Alice either does nothing, or chooses two distinct elements of the array $$$a$$$ and swaps them. Bob chooses either the left half or the right half of the array $$$a$$$ and erases it. The score of the game is defined as the maximum value in $$$a$$$ after all $$$t$$$ turns have been played. Alice wants to maximize this score, while Bob wants to minimize it. You need to output $$$k$$$ numbers: the score of the game if both Alice and Bob play optimally for $$$t$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le 20$$$) — the parameter of the size of $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$2^k$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2^k}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2^k$$$, $$$a_i$$$'s are pairwise distinct) — the given array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$2^k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2^{20}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$k$$$ numbers, where the $$$i$$$-th number is the score of the game if both Alice and Bob play optimally for $$$t = i$$$.",
