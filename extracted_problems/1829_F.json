  "statement": "A snowflake graph is generated from two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, both greater than $$$1$$$, as follows: Start with one central vertex. Connect $$$x$$$ new vertices to this central vertex. Connect $$$y$$$ new vertices to each of these $$$x$$$ vertices. For example, below is a snowflake graph for $$$x=5$$$ and $$$y=3$$$. The snowflake graph above has a central vertex $$$15$$$, then $$$x=5$$$ vertices attached to it ($$$3$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$7$$$, $$$8$$$, and $$$20$$$), and then $$$y=3$$$ vertices attached to each of those. Given a snowflake graph, determine the values of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 200$$$; $$$1 \\leq m \\leq \\min\\left(1000, \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\right)$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The next $$$m$$$ lines each contain two integers each $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$) — the numbers of vertices connected by an edge. The graph does not contain multiple edges and self-loops. It is guaranteed that this graph is a snowflake graph for some integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ both greater than $$$1$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, on a separate line output the values of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, in that order, separated by a space.",
