  "statement": "Let's call an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive (greater than $$$0$$$) integers beautiful if the following condition is held for every $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$: either $$$a_i = 1$$$, or at least one of the numbers $$$a_i - 1$$$ and $$$a_i - 2$$$ exists in the array as well. For example: the array $$$[5, 3, 1]$$$ is beautiful: for $$$a_1$$$, the number $$$a_1 - 2 = 3$$$ exists in the array; for $$$a_2$$$, the number $$$a_2 - 2 = 1$$$ exists in the array; for $$$a_3$$$, the condition $$$a_3 = 1$$$ holds; the array $$$[1, 2, 2, 2, 2]$$$ is beautiful: for $$$a_1$$$, the condition $$$a_1 = 1$$$ holds; for every other number $$$a_i$$$, the number $$$a_i - 1 = 1$$$ exists in the array; the array $$$[1, 4]$$$ is not beautiful: for $$$a_2$$$, neither $$$a_2 - 2 = 2$$$ nor $$$a_2 - 1 = 3$$$ exists in the array, and $$$a_2 \\ne 1$$$; the array $$$[2]$$$ is not beautiful: for $$$a_1$$$, neither $$$a_1 - 1 = 1$$$ nor $$$a_1 - 2 = 0$$$ exists in the array, and $$$a_1 \\ne 1$$$; the array $$$[2, 1, 3]$$$ is beautiful: for $$$a_1$$$, the number $$$a_1 - 1 = 1$$$ exists in the array; for $$$a_2$$$, the condition $$$a_2 = 1$$$ holds; for $$$a_3$$$, the number $$$a_3 - 2 = 1$$$ exists in the array. You are given a positive integer $$$s$$$. Find the minimum possible size of a beautiful array with the sum of elements equal to $$$s$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line contains one integer $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le s \\le 5000$$$) for the $$$i$$$-th test case.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$t$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$-th integer should be the answer for the $$$i$$$-th testcase: the minimum possible size of a beautiful array with the sum of elements equal to $$$s$$$.",
