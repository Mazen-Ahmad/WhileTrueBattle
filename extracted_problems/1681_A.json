  "statement": "Alice and Bob play a game. Alice has $$$n$$$ cards, the $$$i$$$-th of them has the integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it. Bob has $$$m$$$ cards, the $$$j$$$-th of them has the integer $$$b_j$$$ written on it. On the first turn of the game, the first player chooses one of his/her cards and puts it on the table (plays it). On the second turn, the second player chooses one of his/her cards such that the integer on it is greater than the integer on the card played on the first turn , and plays it. On the third turn, the first player chooses one of his/her cards such that the integer on it is greater than the integer on the card played on the second turn , and plays it, and so on — the players take turns, and each player has to choose one of his/her cards with greater integer than the card played by the other player on the last turn. If some player cannot make a turn, he/she loses. For example, if Alice has $$$4$$$ cards with numbers $$$[10, 5, 3, 8]$$$, and Bob has $$$3$$$ cards with numbers $$$[6, 11, 6]$$$, the game may go as follows: Alice can choose any of her cards. She chooses the card with integer $$$5$$$ and plays it. Bob can choose any of his cards with number greater than $$$5$$$. He chooses a card with integer $$$6$$$ and plays it. Alice can choose any of her cards with number greater than $$$6$$$. She chooses the card with integer $$$10$$$ and plays it. Bob can choose any of his cards with number greater than $$$10$$$. He chooses a card with integer $$$11$$$ and plays it. Alice can choose any of her cards with number greater than $$$11$$$, but she has no such cards, so she loses. Both Alice and Bob play optimally (if a player is able to win the game no matter how the other player plays, the former player will definitely win the game) . You have to answer two questions: who wins if Alice is the first player? who wins if Bob is the first player?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line of a test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the number of cards Alice has. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 50$$$) — the numbers written on the cards that Alice has. The third line contains one integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 50$$$) — the number of Bob's cards. The fourth line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 50$$$) — the numbers on Bob's cards.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print two lines. The first line should be Alice if Alice wins when she is the first player; otherwise, the first line should be Bob . The second line should contain the name of the winner if Bob is the first player, in the same format.",
