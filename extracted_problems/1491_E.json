  "statement": "Let $$$F_k$$$ denote the $$$k$$$-th term of Fibonacci sequence, defined as below: $$$F_0 = F_1 = 1$$$ for any integer $$$n \\geq 0$$$, $$$F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n$$$ You are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. We call a tree a Fib-tree , if its number of vertices equals $$$F_k$$$ for some $$$k$$$, and at least one of the following conditions holds: The tree consists of only $$$1$$$ vertex; You can divide it into two Fib-trees by removing some edge of the tree. Determine whether the given tree is a Fib-tree or not.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree. Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follow, each of which contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1\\leq u,v \\leq n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$), representing an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It's guaranteed that given edges form a tree.",
  "outputFormat": "Print \"YES\" if the given tree is a Fib-tree, or \"NO\" otherwise. You can print your answer in any case. For example, if the answer is \" YES \", then the output \" Yes \" or \" yeS \" will also be considered as correct answer.",
