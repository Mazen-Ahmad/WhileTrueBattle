  "statement": "You are given two matrices $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ of size $$$n \\times m$$$, filled with integers between $$$0$$$ and $$$10^9$$$. You can perform the following operations on matrix $$$A$$$ in any order and any number of times: &= : choose two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$x \\ge 0$$$) and replace each element in row $$$i$$$ with the result of the bitwise AND operation between $$$x$$$ and that element. Formally, for every $$$j \\in [1, m]$$$, the element $$$A_{i,j}$$$ is replaced with $$$A_{i,j} \\text{ & } x$$$; |= : choose two integers $$$j$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$, $$$x \\ge 0$$$) and replace each element in column $$$j$$$ with the result of the bitwise OR operation between $$$x$$$ and that element. Formally, for every $$$i \\in [1, n]$$$, the element $$$A_{i,j}$$$ is replaced with $$$A_{i,j} \\text{ | } x$$$. The value of $$$x$$$ may be chosen differently for different operations. Determine whether it is possible to transform matrix $$$A$$$ into matrix $$$B$$$ using the given operations any number of times (including zero).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then, $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case is given as follows: the first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 10^3$$$; $$$n \\cdot m \\le 10^3$$$) — the dimensions of the matrices $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$; the following $$$n$$$ lines describe the matrix $$$A$$$, where the $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$A_{i,1}, A_{i,2}, \\dots, A_{i,m}$$$ ($$$0 \\le A_{i,j} \\le 10^9$$$); the following $$$n$$$ lines describe the matrix $$$B$$$, where the $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$B_{i,1}, B_{i,2}, \\dots, B_{i,m}$$$ ($$$0 \\le B_{i,j} \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output Yes if it is possible to transform the matrix $$$A$$$ into the matrix $$$B$$$; otherwise, output No . Each letter can be output in any case, upper or lower.",
