  "statement": "You are given a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n - 1$$$ edges, and each vertex $$$v$$$ has a counter $$$c(v)$$$ assigned to it. Initially, there is a chip placed at vertex $$$s$$$ and all counters, except $$$c(s)$$$, are set to $$$0$$$; $$$c(s)$$$ is set to $$$1$$$. Your goal is to place the chip at vertex $$$t$$$. You can achieve it by a series of moves. Suppose right now the chip is placed at the vertex $$$v$$$. In one move, you do the following: choose one of neighbors $$$to$$$ of vertex $$$v$$$ uniformly at random ($$$to$$$ is neighbor of $$$v$$$ if and only if there is an edge $$$\\{v, to\\}$$$ in the tree); move the chip to vertex $$$to$$$ and increase $$$c(to)$$$ by $$$1$$$; You'll repeat the move above until you reach the vertex $$$t$$$. For each vertex $$$v$$$ calculate the expected value of $$$c(v)$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le s, t \\le n$$$; $$$s \\neq t$$$) â€” number of vertices in the tree and the starting and finishing vertices. Next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain edges of the tree: one edge per line. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$$$; $$$u_i \\neq v_i$$$), denoting the edge between the nodes $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$n$$$ numbers: expected values of $$$c(v)$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$ for each $$$v$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Formally, let $$$M = 998\\,244\\,353$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.",
