  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the three versions is the constraints on $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved. Maxim is a minibus driver on Venus. To ride on Maxim's minibus, you need a ticket. Each ticket has a number consisting of $$$n$$$ digits. However, as we know, the residents of Venus use a numeral system with base $$$k$$$, rather than the decimal system. Therefore, the ticket number can be considered as a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$k-1$$$, inclusive. The residents of Venus consider a ticket to be lucky if there is a digit on it that is equal to the sum of the remaining digits, modulo $$$k$$$. For example, if $$$k=10$$$, then the ticket $$$7135$$$ is lucky because $$$7 + 1 + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}$$$. On the other hand, the ticket $$$7136$$$ is not lucky because no digit is equal to the sum of the others modulo $$$10$$$. Once, while on a trip, Maxim wondered: how many lucky tickets exist? At the same time, Maxim understands that this number can be very large, so he is interested only in the answer modulo some prime number $$$m$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The only line of the input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 2000$$$, $$$10^8 \\le m \\le 10^9 + 7$$$, $$$m$$$ is a prime number) — the number of digits on the ticket, the base of the numeral system on Venus, and the module for answer calculation.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer — the number of lucky tickets modulo $$$m$$$, i. e. the remainder after dividing the answer by $$$m$$$.",
