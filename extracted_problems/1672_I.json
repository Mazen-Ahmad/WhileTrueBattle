  "statement": "You have a permutation $$$p$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You have a strength of $$$s$$$ and will perform the following operation some times: Choose an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq i \\leq |p|$$$ and $$$|i-p_i| \\leq s$$$. For all $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq j \\leq |p|$$$ and $$$p_i<p_j$$$, update $$$p_j$$$ to $$$p_j-1$$$. Delete the $$$i$$$-th element from $$$p$$$. Formally, update $$$p$$$ to $$$[p_1,\\ldots,p_{i-1},p_{i+1},\\ldots,p_n]$$$. It can be shown that no matter what $$$i$$$ you have chosen, $$$p$$$ will be a permutation of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$|p|$$$ after all operations. You want to be able to transform $$$p$$$ into the empty permutation. Find the minimum strength $$$s$$$ that will allow you to do so.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$. The second line of input conatains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$) — the elements of the permutation $$$p$$$. It is guaranteed that all elements in $$$p$$$ are distinct.",
  "outputFormat": "Print the minimum strength $$$s$$$ required.",
