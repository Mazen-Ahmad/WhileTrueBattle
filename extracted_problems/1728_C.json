  "statement": "Let's define $$$f(x)$$$ for a positive integer $$$x$$$ as the length of the base-10 representation of $$$x$$$ without leading zeros. I like to call it a digital logarithm. Similar to a digital root, if you are familiar with that. You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, each containing $$$n$$$ positive integers. In one operation, you do the following: pick some integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$; assign either $$$f(a_i)$$$ to $$$a_i$$$ or $$$f(b_i)$$$ to $$$b_i$$$. Two arrays are considered similar to each other if you can rearrange the elements in both of them, so that they are equal (e. g. $$$a_i = b_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$). What's the smallest number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ similar to each other?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of the testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in each of the arrays. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i < 10^9$$$). The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_j < 10^9$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print the smallest number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ similar to each other.",
