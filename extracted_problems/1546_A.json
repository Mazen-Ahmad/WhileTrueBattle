  "statement": "AquaMoon and Cirno are playing an interesting game with arrays. Cirno has prepared two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both consist of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. AquaMoon can perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly zero): She chooses two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$), then decreases the $$$i$$$-th element of array $$$a$$$ by $$$1$$$, and increases the $$$j$$$-th element of array $$$a$$$ by $$$1$$$. The resulting values at $$$i$$$-th and $$$j$$$-th index of array $$$a$$$ are $$$a_i - 1$$$ and $$$a_j + 1$$$, respectively. Each element of array $$$a$$$ must be non-negative after each operation . If $$$i = j$$$ this operation doesn't change the array $$$a$$$. AquaMoon wants to make some operations to make arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal. Two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are considered equal if and only if $$$a_i = b_i$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. Help AquaMoon to find a sequence of operations that will solve her problem or find, that it is impossible to make arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal. Please note, that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$$$). The sum of all $$$a_i$$$ does not exceed $$$100$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq b_i \\leq 100$$$). The sum of all $$$b_i$$$ does not exceed $$$100$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print \" -1 \" on the only line if it is impossible to make two arrays equal with some sequence of operations. Otherwise, print an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\leq m \\leq 100$$$) in the first line — the number of operations. Then print $$$m$$$ lines, each line consists of two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ — the indices you choose for the operation. It can be proven that if it is possible to make two arrays equal with some sequence of operations, there exists a sequence with $$$m \\leq 100$$$. If there are multiple possible solutions, you can print any.",
