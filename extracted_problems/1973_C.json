  "statement": "Fox loves permutations! She came up with the following problem and asked Cat to solve it: You are given an even positive integer $$$n$$$ and a permutation$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The score of another permutation $$$q$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is the number of local maximums in the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where $$$a_i = p_i + q_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$). In other words, the score of $$$q$$$ is the number of $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 < i < n$$$ (note the strict inequalities), $$$a_{i-1} < a_i$$$, and $$$a_i > a_{i+1}$$$ (once again, note the strict inequalities). Find the permutation $$$q$$$ that achieves the maximum score for given $$$n$$$ and $$$p$$$. If there exist multiple such permutations, you can pick any of them. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the input you will have to solve. The first line of each test case contains one even integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$n$$$ is even) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$. The second line of each test case contains the $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$p$$$ is a permutation of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one line containing any permutation of length $$$n$$$ (the array $$$q$$$), such that $$$q$$$ maximizes the score under the given constraints.",
