  "statement": "A permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ is perfect if, for each index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$), it satisfies the following: The sum of the first $$$i$$$ elements $$$p_1 + p_2 + \\ldots + p_i$$$ is not a perfect square$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$. You would like things to be perfect. Given a positive integer $$$n$$$, find a perfect permutation of length $$$n$$$, or print $$$-1$$$ if none exists. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer, e.g., $$$9=3^2$$$ is a perfect square, but $$$8$$$ and $$$14$$$ are not.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case: If no solution exists, print a single integer $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, print $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ — the perfect permutation you find. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
