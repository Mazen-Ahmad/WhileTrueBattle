  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, $$$1\\le n\\le 5\\cdot 10^3$$$ and you don't need to output the answer for each prefix. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. Leo works as a programmer in the city center, and his lover teaches at a high school in the suburbs. Every weekend, Leo would ride his bike to the suburbs to spend a nice weekend with his lover. There are $$$n$$$ cyclists riding in front of Leo on this road right now. They are numbered $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$n$$$ from front to back. Initially, Leo is behind the $$$n$$$-th cyclist. The $$$i$$$-th cyclist has an agility value $$$a_i$$$. Leo wants to get ahead of the $$$1$$$-st cyclist. Leo can take the following actions as many times as he wants: Assuming that the first person in front of Leo is cyclist $$$i$$$, he can go in front of cyclist $$$i$$$ for a cost of $$$a_i$$$. This puts him behind cyclist $$$i - 1$$$. Using his super powers, swap $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1\\le i < j\\le n$$$) for a cost of $$$(j - i)$$$. Leo wants to know the minimum cost to get in front of the $$$1$$$-st cyclist. Here you only need to print the answer for the whole array, i.e. $$$[a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5\\cdot 10^3$$$), representing the number of the cyclists. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^3$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer representing the minimum cost for Leo to go from behind the $$$n$$$-th cyclist to in front of the $$$1$$$-st cyclist.",
