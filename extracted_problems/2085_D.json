  "statement": "Serval has just found a Kaitenzushi buffet restaurant. Kaitenzushi means that there is a conveyor belt in the restaurant, delivering plates of sushi in front of the customer, Serval. In this restaurant, each plate contains exactly $$$k$$$ pieces of sushi and the $$$i$$$-th plate has a deliciousness $$$d_i$$$. Serval will have a meal in this restaurant for $$$n$$$ minutes, and within the $$$n$$$ minutes, he must eat up all the pieces of sushi he took from the belt. Denote the counter for uneaten taken pieces of sushi as $$$r$$$. Initially, $$$r=0$$$. In the $$$i$$$-th minute ($$$1\\leq i\\leq n$$$), only the $$$i$$$-th plate of sushi will be delivered in front of Serval, and he can do one of the following: Take the $$$i$$$-th plate of sushi (whose deliciousness is $$$d_i$$$) from the belt, and $$$r$$$ will be increased by $$$k$$$; Eat one uneaten piece of sushi that he took from the belt before, and $$$r$$$ will be decreased by $$$1$$$. Note that you can do this only if $$$r>0$$$; Or, do nothing, and $$$r$$$ will remain unchanged. Note that after the $$$n$$$ minutes, the value of $$$r$$$ must be $$$0$$$. Serval wants to maximize the sum of the deliciousnesses of all the plates he took. Help him find it out!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\leq k<n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of minutes of the meal and the number of sushi pieces in each plate. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq d_i\\leq 10^9$$$) — the deliciousness of each plate. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of the deliciousnesses of all the plates Serval took.",
