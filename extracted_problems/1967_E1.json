  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The differences between the two versions are the constraints on $$$n, m, b_0$$$ and the time limit. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved. Little R has counted many sets before, and now she decides to count arrays. Little R thinks an array $$$b_0, \\ldots, b_n$$$ consisting of non-negative integers is continuous if and only if, for each $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, $$$\\lvert b_i - b_{i-1} \\rvert = 1$$$ is satisfied. She likes continuity, so she only wants to generate continuous arrays. If Little R is given $$$b_0$$$ and $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$, she will try to generate a non-negative continuous array $$$b$$$, which has no similarity with $$$a$$$. More formally, for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$ holds. However, Little R does not have any array $$$a$$$. Instead, she gives you $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$b_0$$$. She wants to count the different integer arrays $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$ satisfying: $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq m$$$; At least one non-negative continuous array $$$b_0, \\ldots, b_n$$$ can be generated. Note that $$$b_i \\geq 0$$$, but the $$$b_i$$$ can be arbitrarily large. Since the actual answer may be enormous, please just tell her the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t\\ (1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4)$$$. The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$b_0$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq b_0 \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the length of the array $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$, the maximum possible element in $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$, and the initial element of the array $$$b_0, \\ldots, b_n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceeds $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of different arrays $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$ satisfying the conditions, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
