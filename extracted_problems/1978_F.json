  "statement": "Given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Let's construct a square matrix $$$b$$$ of size $$$n \\times n$$$, in which the $$$i$$$-th row contains the array $$$a$$$ cyclically shifted to the right by $$$(i - 1)$$$. For example, for the array $$$a = [3, 4, 5]$$$, the obtained matrix is $$$$$$b = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 5 & 3 & 4 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}$$$$$$ Let's construct the following graph: The graph contains $$$n^2$$$ vertices, each of which corresponds to one of the elements of the matrix. Let's denote the vertex corresponding to the element $$$b_{i, j}$$$ as $$$(i, j)$$$. We will draw an edge between vertices $$$(i_1, j_1)$$$ and $$$(i_2, j_2)$$$ if $$$|i_1 - i_2| + |j_1 - j_2| \\le k$$$ and $$$\\gcd(b_{i_1, j_1}, b_{i_2, j_2}) > 1$$$, where $$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Your task is to calculate the number of connected components$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ in the obtained graph. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$A connected component of a graph is a set of vertices in which any vertex is reachable from any other via edges, and adding any other vertex to the set violates this rule.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$, $$$2 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^6$$$) — the length of the array and the parameter $$$k$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of connected components in the obtained graph.",
