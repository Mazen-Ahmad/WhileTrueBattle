  "statement": "For an array $$$[a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n]$$$ of length $$$n$$$, define $$$f(a)$$$ as the sum of the minimum element over all subsegments. That is, $$$$$$f(a)=\\sum_{l=1}^n\\sum_{r=l}^n \\min_{l\\le i\\le r}a_i.$$$$$$ A permutation is a sequence of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ containing each number exactly once. You are given a permutation $$$[a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n]$$$. For each $$$i$$$, solve the following problem independently: Erase $$$a_i$$$ from $$$a$$$, concatenating the remaining parts, resulting in $$$b = [a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{i-1},\\;a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_{n}]$$$. Calculate $$$f(b)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 5\\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one line containing $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be the answer when erasing $$$a_i$$$.",
