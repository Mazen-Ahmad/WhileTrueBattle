  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ words of equal length $$$m$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters. The $$$i$$$-th word is denoted $$$s_i$$$. In one move you can choose any position in any single word and change the letter at that position to the previous or next letter in alphabetical order. For example: you can change ' e ' to ' d ' or to ' f '; ' a ' can only be changed to ' b '; ' z ' can only be changed to ' y '. The difference between two words is the minimum number of moves required to make them equal. For example, the difference between \" best \" and \" cost \" is $$$1 + 10 + 0 + 0 = 11$$$. Find the minimum difference of $$$s_i$$$ and $$$s_j$$$ such that $$$(i < j)$$$. In other words, find the minimum difference over all possible pairs of the $$$n$$$ words.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 8$$$) — the number of strings and their length respectively. Then follows $$$n$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which containing a single string $$$s_i$$$ of length $$$m$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum difference over all possible pairs of the given strings.",
