  "statement": "Winter holidays are coming up. They are going to last for $$$n$$$ days. During the holidays, Monocarp wants to try all of these activities exactly once with his friends: go skiing; watch a movie in a cinema; play board games. Monocarp knows that, on the $$$i$$$-th day, exactly $$$a_i$$$ friends will join him for skiing, $$$b_i$$$ friends will join him for a movie and $$$c_i$$$ friends will join him for board games. Monocarp also knows that he can't try more than one activity in a single day. Thus, he asks you to help him choose three distinct days $$$x, y, z$$$ in such a way that the total number of friends to join him for the activities ($$$a_x + b_y + c_z$$$) is maximized.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the duration of the winter holidays in days. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^8$$$) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for skiing on the $$$i$$$-th day. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^8$$$) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for a movie on the $$$i$$$-th day. The fourth line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le 10^8$$$) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for board games on the $$$i$$$-th day. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum total number of friends that can join Monocarp for the activities on three distinct days.",
