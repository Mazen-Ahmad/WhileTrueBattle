  "statement": "You are standing at the point $$$0$$$ on a coordinate line. Your goal is to reach the point $$$n$$$. In one minute, you can move by $$$2$$$ or by $$$3$$$ to the left or to the right (i. e., if your current coordinate is $$$x$$$, it can become $$$x-3$$$, $$$x-2$$$, $$$x+2$$$ or $$$x+3$$$). Note that the new coordinate can become negative. Your task is to find the minimum number of minutes required to get from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$n$$$. You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ lines describing the test cases follow. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$) — the goal of the $$$i$$$-th test case.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of minutes required to get from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$n$$$ for the corresponding test case.",
