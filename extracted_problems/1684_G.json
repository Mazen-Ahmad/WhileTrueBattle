  "statement": "Let's consider Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor , where $$$t$$$ is a list: function Euclid(a, b): if a < b: swap(a, b) if b == 0: return a r = reminder from dividing a by b if r > 0: append r to the back of t return Euclid(b, r) There is an array $$$p$$$ of pairs of positive integers that are not greater than $$$m$$$. Initially, the list $$$t$$$ is empty. Then the function is run on each pair in $$$p$$$. After that the list $$$t$$$ is shuffled and given to you. You have to find an array $$$p$$$ of any size not greater than $$$2 \\cdot 10^4$$$ that produces the given list $$$t$$$, or tell that no such array exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^3$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$t$$$ and the constraint for integers in pairs. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le t_i \\le m$$$) — the elements of the array $$$t$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "If the answer does not exist, output $$$-1$$$. If the answer exists, in the first line output $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the size of your array $$$p$$$, i. e. the number of pairs in the answer. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$k$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le m$$$) — the $$$i$$$-th pair in $$$p$$$. If there are multiple valid answers you can output any of them.",
