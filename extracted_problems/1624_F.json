  "statement": "This problem is interactive. We decided to play a game with you and guess the number $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x < n$$$), where you know the number $$$n$$$. You can make queries like this: + c : this command assigns $$$x = x + c$$$ ($$$1 \\le c < n$$$) and then returns you the value $$$\\lfloor\\frac{x}{n}\\rfloor$$$ ($$$x$$$ divide by $$$n$$$ and round down). You win if you guess the current number with no more than $$$10$$$ queries.",
