  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, $$$m$$$ is arbitrary. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. There is a problem-solving competition in Ancient Egypt with $$$n$$$ participants, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each participant comes from a certain city; the cities are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. There is at least one participant from each city. The $$$i$$$-th participant has strength $$$a_i$$$, specialization $$$s_i$$$, and wisdom $$$b_i$$$, so that $$$b_i \\ge a_i$$$. Each problem in the competition will have a difficulty $$$d$$$ and a unique topic $$$t$$$. The $$$i$$$-th participant will solve the problem if $$$a_i \\ge d$$$, i.e., their strength is not less than the problem's difficulty, or $$$s_i = t$$$, and $$$b_i \\ge d$$$, i.e., their specialization matches the problem's topic, and their wisdom is not less than the problem's difficulty. Cheops wants to choose the problems in such a way that each participant from city $$$i$$$ will solve strictly more problems than each participant from city $$$j$$$, for all $$$i < j$$$. Please find a set of at most $$$5n$$$ problems, where the topics of all problems are distinct , so that Cheops' will is satisfied, or state that it is impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\le T \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le m \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot {10}^5$$$) — the number of participants and the number of cities. The following $$$n$$$ lines describe the participants. The $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers —$$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$s_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i, b_i, s_i \\le {10}^9$$$, $$$a_i \\le b_i$$$) — strength, wisdom, and specialization of the $$$i$$$-th participant, respectively. The next $$$m$$$ lines describe the cities. In the $$$i$$$-th line, the first number is an integer $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le k_i \\le n$$$) — the number of participants from the $$$i$$$-th city. It is followed by $$$k_i$$$ integers $$$q_{i, 1}, q_{i, 2}, \\ldots, q_{i, k_i}$$$ — ($$$1 \\le q_{i, j} \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le j \\le k_i$$$) — the indices of the participants from this city. It is guaranteed that each participant is mentioned exactly once. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there exists a set of problems that satisfies Cheops' conditions, then in the first line output a single integer $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\le p \\le 5n$$$) — the number of problems in your solution. Then output $$$p$$$ lines, each containing two integers $$$d$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$0 \\le d, t \\le {10}^9$$$) — the difficulty and topic of the respective problem. The topics must be distinct. If there is no set of problems that meets Cheops' wishes, print $$$-1$$$ instead.",
