  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, where $$$n \\leq 8$$$ and $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n \\leq 100$$$. Construct a simple polygon$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ with at most $$$333$$$ vertices that has exactly $$$$$$\\frac{(a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n)!}{a_1! a_2! \\cdots a_n!}$$$$$$ different triangulations$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$. It can be proven that such a polygon always exists. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A simple polygon is a polygon that does not intersect itself and has no holes. In other words, no two non-consecutive edges can have common points, and consecutive edges must have exactly one common point — the vertex between them. Consecutive edges may be collinear. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A triangulation of a polygon with $$$m$$$ vertices is a set of $$$m-3$$$ diagonals that intersect only at vertices. A diagonal is a segment between two vertices which lies inside the polygon and has exactly two common points with the polygon sides — the vertices it connects.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of each test contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 8$$$) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n$$$ does not exceed $$$100$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "In the first line, output a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \\leq m \\leq 333$$$) — the number of vertices in the polygon. In the $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines, output two integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^6$$$) — the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th vertex of the polygon. The polygon must be simple. The vertices may be given in either clockwise or counterclockwise order.",
