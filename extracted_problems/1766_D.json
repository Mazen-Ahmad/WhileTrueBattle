  "statement": "Let's name a pair of positive integers $$$(x, y)$$$ lucky if the greatest common divisor of them is equal to $$$1$$$ ($$$\\gcd(x, y) = 1$$$). Let's define a chain induced by $$$(x, y)$$$ as a sequence of pairs $$$(x, y)$$$, $$$(x + 1, y + 1)$$$, $$$(x + 2, y + 2)$$$, $$$\\dots$$$, $$$(x + k, y + k)$$$ for some integer $$$k \\ge 0$$$. The length of the chain is the number of pairs it consists of, or $$$(k + 1)$$$. Let's name such chain lucky if all pairs in the chain are lucky. You are given $$$n$$$ pairs $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. Calculate for each pair the length of the longest lucky chain induced by this pair. Note that if $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ is not lucky itself, the chain will have the length $$$0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$) — the number of pairs. Next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$n$$$ pairs — one per line. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i < y_i \\le 10^7$$$) — the corresponding pair.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th integer is the length of the longest lucky chain induced by $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ or $$$-1$$$ if the chain can be infinitely long.",
