  "statement": "Let's define a function $$$f(x)$$$ ($$$x$$$ is a positive integer) as follows: write all digits of the decimal representation of $$$x$$$ backwards, then get rid of the leading zeroes. For example, $$$f(321) = 123$$$, $$$f(120) = 21$$$, $$$f(1000000) = 1$$$, $$$f(111) = 111$$$. Let's define another function $$$g(x) = \\dfrac{x}{f(f(x))}$$$ ($$$x$$$ is a positive integer as well). Your task is the following: for the given positive integer $$$n$$$, calculate the number of different values of $$$g(x)$$$ among all numbers $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\le x \\le n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n < 10^{100}$$$). This integer is given without leading zeroes.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the number of different values of the function $$$g(x)$$$, if $$$x$$$ can be any integer from $$$[1, n]$$$.",
