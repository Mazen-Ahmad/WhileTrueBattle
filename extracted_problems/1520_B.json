  "statement": "Let's call a positive integer $$$n$$$ ordinary if in the decimal notation all its digits are the same. For example, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$99$$$ are ordinary numbers, but $$$719$$$ and $$$2021$$$ are not ordinary numbers. For a given number $$$n$$$, find the number of ordinary numbers among the numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case is characterized by one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output the number of ordinary numbers among numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.",
