  "statement": "In a parallel universe there are $$$n$$$ chemical elements, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The element number $$$n$$$ has not been discovered so far, and its discovery would be a pinnacle of research and would bring the person who does it eternal fame and the so-called SWERC prize. There are $$$m$$$ independent researchers, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, that are trying to discover it. Currently, the $$$i$$$-th researcher has a sample of the element $$$s_i$$$. Every year, each researcher independently does one fusion experiment . In a fusion experiment, if the researcher currently has a sample of element $$$a$$$, they produce a sample of an element $$$b$$$ that is chosen uniformly at random between $$$a+1$$$ and $$$n$$$, and they lose the sample of element $$$a$$$. The elements discovered by different researchers or in different years are completely independent. The first researcher to discover element $$$n$$$ will get the SWERC prize. If several researchers discover the element in the same year, they all get the prize. For each $$$i = 1, \\, 2, \\, \\dots, \\, m$$$, you need to compute the probability that the $$$i$$$-th researcher wins the prize.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 100$$$) — the number of elements and the number of researchers. The second line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$s_1, \\, s_2, \\, \\dots, \\, s_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le s_i < n$$$) — the elements that the researchers currently have.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$m$$$ floating-point numbers. The $$$i$$$-th number should be the probability that the $$$i$$$-th researcher wins the SWERC prize. Your answer is accepted if each number differs from the correct number by at most $$$10^{-8}$$$.",
