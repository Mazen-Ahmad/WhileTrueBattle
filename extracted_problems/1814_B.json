  "statement": "A robot is placed in a cell $$$(0, 0)$$$ of an infinite grid. This robot has adjustable length legs. Initially, its legs have length $$$1$$$. Let the robot currently be in the cell $$$(x, y)$$$ and have legs of length $$$m$$$. In one move, it can perform one of the following three actions: jump into the cell $$$(x + m, y)$$$; jump into the cell $$$(x, y + m)$$$; increase the length of the legs by $$$1$$$, i. e. set it to $$$m + 1$$$. What's the smallest number of moves robot has to make to reach a cell $$$(a, b)$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$) — the ending cell.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the smallest number of moves the robot is required to make to reach a cell $$$(a, b)$$$ from a cell $$$(0, 0)$$$.",
