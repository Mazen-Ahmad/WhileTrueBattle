  "statement": "You are given a binary array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements, a binary array is an array consisting only of $$$0$$$s and $$$1$$$s. A blank space is a segment of consecutive elements consisting of only $$$0$$$s. Your task is to find the length of the longest blank space.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 1$$$) — the elements of the array.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest blank space.",
