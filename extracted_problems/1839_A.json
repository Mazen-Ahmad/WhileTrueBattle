  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. An array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of zeroes and ones is good if for all integers $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ both of the following conditions are satisfied: at least $$$\\lceil \\frac{i}{k} \\rceil$$$ of the first $$$i$$$ elements of $$$a$$$ are equal to $$$1$$$, at least $$$\\lceil \\frac{i}{k} \\rceil$$$ of the last $$$i$$$ elements of $$$a$$$ are equal to $$$1$$$. Here, $$$\\lceil \\frac{i}{k} \\rceil$$$ denotes the result of division of $$$i$$$ by $$$k$$$, rounded up. For example, $$$\\lceil \\frac{6}{3} \\rceil = 2$$$, $$$\\lceil \\frac{11}{5} \\rceil = \\lceil 2.2 \\rceil = 3$$$ and $$$\\lceil \\frac{7}{4} \\rceil = \\lceil 1.75 \\rceil = 2$$$. Find the minimum possible number of ones in a good array.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) — the length of array and parameter $$$k$$$ from the statement.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output one integer — the minimum possible number of ones in a good array. It can be shown that under the given constraints at least one good array always exists.",
