  "statement": "You are given two integer arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can reverse at most one subarray (continuous subsegment) of the array $$$a$$$. Your task is to reverse such a subarray that the sum $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n a_i \\cdot b_i$$$ is maximized .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5000$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^7$$$). The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^7$$$).",
