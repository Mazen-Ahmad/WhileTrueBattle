  "statement": "Shohag has an array $$$a$$$ of integers. Initially $$$a = [0, 1]$$$. He can repeatedly perform the following operation any number of times: Let $$$k$$$ be the number of inversions$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ in the current array $$$a$$$. Insert $$$k$$$ at any position in $$$a$$$, including the beginning or the end. For example, if $$$a = [4, 6, 2, 4]$$$, then the number of inversions is $$$k = 3$$$. So Shohag can obtain the following arrays after the operation: $$$[\\textbf{3}, 4, 6, 2, 4]$$$, $$$[4, \\textbf{3}, 6, 2, 4]$$$, $$$[4, 6, \\textbf{3}, 2, 4]$$$, $$$[4, 6, 2, \\textbf{3}, 4]$$$, and $$$[4, 6, 2, 4, \\textbf{3}]$$$. Given an integer $$$n$$$, help Shohag count, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$, the number of distinct arrays of length $$$n$$$ that can be obtained after performing the operations. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The number of inversions in an array $$$a$$$ is the number of pairs of indices ($$$i$$$, $$$j$$$) such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output an integer — the number of possible arrays modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
