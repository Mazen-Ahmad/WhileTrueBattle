  "statement": "The two versions of the problem are different. You may want to read both versions. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved. You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Start with $$$c = 0$$$. Then, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (in increasing order) do exactly one of the following: Option $$$1$$$: set $$$c$$$ to $$$c + a_i$$$. Option $$$2$$$: set $$$c$$$ to $$$|c + a_i|$$$, where $$$|x|$$$ is the absolute value of $$$x$$$. Let the maximum final value of $$$c$$$ after the procedure described above be equal to $$$k$$$. Find $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_3$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
