  "statement": "FizzBuzz is one of the most well-known problems from coding interviews. In this problem, we will consider a remixed version of FizzBuzz: Given an integer $$$n$$$, process all integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$. For every integer such that its remainders modulo $$$3$$$ and modulo $$$5$$$ are the same (so, for every integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$i \\bmod 3 = i \\bmod 5$$$), print FizzBuzz . However, you don't have to solve it. Instead, given the integer $$$n$$$, you have to report how many times the correct solution to that problem will print FizzBuzz .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains one line consisting of one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$0 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the number of times the correct solution will print FizzBuzz with the given value of $$$n$$$.",
