  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. You must perform the following algorithm on $$$s$$$: Let $$$x$$$ be the length of the longest prefix of $$$s$$$ which occurs somewhere else in $$$s$$$ as a contiguous substring (the other occurrence may also intersect the prefix). If $$$x = 0$$$, break. Otherwise, remove the first $$$x$$$ characters of $$$s$$$, and repeat. A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. An empty prefix is also a valid prefix. For example, the string \" abcd \" has 5 prefixes: empty string, \" a \", \" ab \", \" abc \" and \" abcd \". For instance, if we perform the algorithm on $$$s =$$$ \" abcabdc \", Initially, \" ab \" is the longest prefix that also appears somewhere else as a substring in $$$s$$$, so $$$s =$$$ \" cabdc \" after $$$1$$$ operation. Then, \" c \" is the longest prefix that also appears somewhere else as a substring in $$$s$$$, so $$$s =$$$ \" abdc \" after $$$2$$$ operations. Now $$$x=0$$$ (because there are no non-empty prefixes of \" abdc \" that also appear somewhere else as a substring in $$$s$$$), so the algorithm terminates. Find the final state of the string after performing the algorithm.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. This is followed by $$$t$$$ lines, each containing a description of one test case. Each line contains a string $$$s$$$. The given strings consist only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet and have lengths between $$$1$$$ and $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ inclusive. It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of $$$s$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line containing the string $$$s$$$ after executing the algorithm. It can be shown that such string is non-empty.",
