  "statement": "Sam changed his school and on the first biology lesson he got a very interesting task about genes. You are given $$$n$$$ arrays, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains $$$m$$$ different integers — $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2},\\ldots,a_{i,m}$$$. Also you are given an array of integers $$$w$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Find the minimum value of $$$w_i + w_j$$$ among all pairs of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$), such that the numbers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2},\\ldots,a_{i,m}, a_{j,1}, a_{j,2},\\ldots,a_{j,m}$$$ are distinct.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 5$$$). The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines starts with $$$m$$$ distinct integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\ldots, a_{i,m}$$$ and then $$$w_i$$$ follows ($$$1\\leq a_{i,j} \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\leq w_{i} \\leq 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single number — the answer to the problem. If there are no suitable pairs $$$(i, j)$$$, print $$$-1$$$.",
