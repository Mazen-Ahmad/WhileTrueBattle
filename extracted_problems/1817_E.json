  "statement": "You're given a multiset of non-negative integers $$$\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n\\}$$$. In one step you take two elements $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ of the multiset, remove them and insert their mean value $$$\\frac{x + y}{2}$$$ back into the multiset. You repeat the step described above until you are left with only two numbers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$. What is the maximum possible value of their absolute difference $$$|A-B|$$$? Since the answer is not an integer number, output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$) — the size of the multiset. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the multiset. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer, the answer to the problem modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. Formally, let $$$M = 10^9+7$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.",
