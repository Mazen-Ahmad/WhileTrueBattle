  "statement": "You are given a rooted tree, consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the root is the vertex $$$1$$$. You can perform the following operation at most $$$k$$$ times: choose an edge $$$(v, u)$$$ of the tree such that $$$v$$$ is a parent of $$$u$$$; remove the edge $$$(v, u)$$$; add an edge $$$(1, u)$$$ (i. e. make $$$u$$$ with its subtree a child of the root). The height of a tree is the maximum depth of its vertices, and the depth of a vertex is the number of edges on the path from the root to it. For example, the depth of vertex $$$1$$$ is $$$0$$$, since it's the root, and the depth of all its children is $$$1$$$. What's the smallest height of the tree that can be achieved?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le n - 1$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum number of operations you can perform. The second line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i < i$$$) — the parent of the $$$i$$$-th vertex. Vertex $$$1$$$ is the root. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print a single integer — the smallest height of the tree that can achieved by performing at most $$$k$$$ operations.",
