  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. In one turn, you can do one of the following operations: Take an integer $$$c$$$ ($$$c > 1$$$ and $$$a$$$ should be divisible by $$$c$$$ ) and replace $$$a$$$ with $$$\\frac{a}{c}$$$; Take an integer $$$c$$$ ($$$c > 1$$$ and $$$b$$$ should be divisible by $$$c$$$ ) and replace $$$b$$$ with $$$\\frac{b}{c}$$$. Your goal is to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$ using exactly $$$k$$$ turns. For example, the numbers $$$a=36$$$ and $$$b=48$$$ can be made equal in $$$4$$$ moves: $$$c=6$$$, divide $$$b$$$ by $$$c$$$ $$$\\Rightarrow$$$ $$$a=36$$$, $$$b=8$$$; $$$c=2$$$, divide $$$a$$$ by $$$c$$$ $$$\\Rightarrow$$$ $$$a=18$$$, $$$b=8$$$; $$$c=9$$$, divide $$$a$$$ by $$$c$$$ $$$\\Rightarrow$$$ $$$a=2$$$, $$$b=8$$$; $$$c=4$$$, divide $$$b$$$ by $$$c$$$ $$$\\Rightarrow$$$ $$$a=2$$$, $$$b=2$$$. For the given numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, determine whether it is possible to make them equal using exactly $$$k$$$ turns.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case is contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b, k \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output: \" Yes \", if it is possible to make the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal in exactly $$$k$$$ turns; \" No \" otherwise. The strings \" Yes \" and \" No \" can be output in any case.",
