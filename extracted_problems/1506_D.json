  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of integers. You can apply the following operation, consisting of several steps, on the array $$$a$$$ zero or more times: you select two different numbers in the array $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$; you remove $$$i$$$-th and $$$j$$$-th elements from the array. For example, if $$$n=6$$$ and $$$a=[1, 6, 1, 1, 4, 4]$$$, then you can perform the following sequence of operations: select $$$i=1, j=5$$$. The array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[6, 1, 1, 4]$$$; select $$$i=1, j=2$$$. The array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[1, 4]$$$. What can be the minimum size of the array after applying some sequence of operations to it?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) is length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
