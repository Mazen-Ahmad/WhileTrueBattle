  "statement": "You are given a weighted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected graph without any cycles. A weighted tree is a tree in which each edge has a certain weight. The tree is undirected, it doesn't have a root. Since trees bore you, you decided to challenge yourself and play a game on the given tree. In a move, you can travel from a node to one of its neighbors (another node it has a direct edge with). You start with a variable $$$x$$$ which is initially equal to $$$0$$$. When you pass through edge $$$i$$$, $$$x$$$ changes its value to $$$x ~\\mathsf{XOR}~ w_i$$$ (where $$$w_i$$$ is the weight of the $$$i$$$-th edge). Your task is to go from vertex $$$a$$$ to vertex $$$b$$$, but you are allowed to enter node $$$b$$$ if and only if after traveling to it, the value of $$$x$$$ will become $$$0$$$. In other words, you can travel to node $$$b$$$ only by using an edge $$$i$$$ such that $$$x ~\\mathsf{XOR}~ w_i = 0$$$. Once you enter node $$$b$$$ the game ends and you win. Additionally, you can teleport at most once at any point in time to any vertex except vertex $$$b$$$. You can teleport from any vertex, even from $$$a$$$. Answer with \" YES \" if you can reach vertex $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$, and \" NO \" otherwise. Note that $$$\\mathsf{XOR}$$$ represents the bitwise XOR operation .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$), ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n; a \\ne b$$$) — the number of vertices, and the starting and desired ending node respectively. Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines denotes an edge of the tree. Edge $$$i$$$ is denoted by three integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ and $$$w_i$$$ — the labels of vertices it connects ($$$1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n; u_i \\ne v_i; 1 \\leq w_i \\leq 10^9$$$) and the weight of the respective edge. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output \" YES \" if you can reach vertex $$$b$$$, and \" NO \" otherwise.",
