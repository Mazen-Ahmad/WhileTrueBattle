  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ cities in a row numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The cities will be building broadcasting stations. The station in the $$$i$$$-th city has height $$$h_i$$$ and range $$$w_i$$$. It can broadcast information to city $$$j$$$ if the following constraints are met: $$$i \\le j \\le w_i$$$, and for each $$$k$$$ such that $$$i < k \\le j$$$, the following condition holds: $$$h_k < h_i$$$. In other words, the station in city $$$i$$$ can broadcast information to city $$$j$$$ if $$$j \\ge i$$$, $$$j$$$ is in the range of $$$i$$$-th station, and $$$i$$$ is strictly highest on the range from $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$ (including city $$$j$$$). At the beginning, for every city $$$i$$$, $$$h_i = 0$$$ and $$$w_i = i$$$. Then $$$q$$$ events will take place. During $$$i$$$-th event one of the following will happen: City $$$c_i$$$ will rebuild its station so that its height will be strictly highest among all stations and $$$w_{c_i}$$$ will be set to $$$g_i$$$. Let $$$b_j$$$ be the number of stations that can broadcast information to city $$$j$$$. Print the sum of $$$b_j$$$ over all $$$j$$$ satisfying $$$l_i \\le j \\le r_i$$$. Your task is to react to all events and print answers to all queries.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — number of cities and number of events. Then $$$q$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line begins with an integer $$$p_i$$$ ($$$p_i = 1$$$ or $$$p_i = 2$$$). If $$$p_i = 1$$$ a station will be rebuilt. Then two integers $$$c_i$$$ and $$$g_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le g_i \\le n$$$) follow — the city in which the station is rebuilt and its new broadcasting range. If $$$p_i = 2$$$ you are given a query. Then two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$) follow — the range of cities in the query.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print in a single line the sum of $$$b_j$$$ over the given interval.",
