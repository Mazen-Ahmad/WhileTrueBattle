  "statement": "Ngọt - LẦN CUỐI (đi bên em xót xa người ơi) ඞ There are $$$n$$$ lamps numbered $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ lined up in a row, initially turned off. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose two non-adjacent $$${}^\\dagger$$$ lamps that are currently turned off, then turn them on. Determine whether you can reach configuration $$$s$$$, where $$$s_i = 1$$$ means the $$$i$$$-th lamp is turned on, and $$$s_i = 0$$$ otherwise. $$${}^\\dagger$$$ Only lamp $$$i$$$ and $$$i + 1$$$ are adjacent for all $$$1 \\le i < n$$$. Note that lamp $$$n$$$ and $$$1$$$ are not adjacent when $$$n \\ne 2$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the number of lamps. The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of size $$$n$$$ — the final desired configuration.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print on one line \"YES\" if we can reach the configuration $$$s$$$ via applying the given operation any number of times. Otherwise, print \"NO\" .",
