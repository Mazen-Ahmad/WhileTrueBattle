  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$. You have to apply $$$m$$$ operations to it. In a single operation, you must replace every digit $$$d$$$ of the number with the decimal representation of integer $$$d + 1$$$. For example, $$$1912$$$ becomes $$$21023$$$ after applying the operation once. You have to find the length of $$$n$$$ after applying $$$m$$$ operations. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$) and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the initial number and the number of operations.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output the length of the resulting number modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
