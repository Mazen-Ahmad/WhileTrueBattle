  "statement": "You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$. Find the maximum possible median of an array of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers (not necessarily distinct), such that the sum of its elements is equal to $$$s$$$. A median of an array of integers of length $$$m$$$ is the number standing on the $$$\\lceil {\\frac{m}{2}} \\rceil$$$-th (rounding up) position in the non-decreasing ordering of its elements. Positions are numbered starting from $$$1$$$. For example, a median of the array $$$[20,40,20,50,50,30]$$$ is the $$$\\lceil \\frac{m}{2} \\rceil$$$-th element of $$$[20,20,30,40,50,50]$$$, so it is $$$30$$$. There exist other definitions of the median, but in this problem we use the described definition.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. Each test case contains a single line with two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, s \\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the required sum of the elements.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single integer — the maximum possible median.",
