  "statement": "You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. An array $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_m$$$ is beautiful if there exists an array $$$y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_m$$$ such that the elements of $$$y$$$ are distinct (in other words, $$$y_i\\neq y_j$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i < j \\le m$$$), and the product of $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ is the same for all $$$1 \\le i \\le m$$$ (in other words, $$$x_i\\cdot y_i = x_j\\cdot y_j$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i < j \\le m$$$). Your task is to determine the maximum size of a subsequence$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of array $$$a$$$ that is beautiful. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum size of a subsequence of array $$$a$$$ that is beautiful.",
