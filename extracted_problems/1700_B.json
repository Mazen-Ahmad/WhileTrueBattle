  "statement": "During a daily walk Alina noticed a long number written on the ground. Now Alina wants to find some positive number of same length without leading zeroes, such that the sum of these two numbers is a palindrome. Recall that a number is called a palindrome, if it reads the same right to left and left to right. For example, numbers $$$121, 66, 98989$$$ are palindromes, and $$$103, 239, 1241$$$ are not palindromes. Alina understands that a valid number always exist. Help her find one!",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Next, descriptions of $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000$$$) — the length of the number that is written on the ground. The second line of contains the positive $$$n$$$-digit integer without leading zeroes — the number itself. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100\\,000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each of $$$t$$$ test cases print an answer — a positive $$$n$$$-digit integer without leading zeros, such that the sum of the input integer and this number is a palindrome. We can show that at least one number satisfying the constraints exists. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.",
