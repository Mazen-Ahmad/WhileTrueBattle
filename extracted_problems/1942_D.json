  "statement": "Pristine Beat - Touhou ⠀ Elsie is learning how to paint. She has a canvas of $$$n$$$ cells numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and can paint any (potentially empty) subset of cells. Elsie has a 2D array $$$a$$$ which she will use to evaluate paintings. Let the maximal contiguous intervals of painted cells in a painting be $$$[l_1,r_1],[l_2,r_2],\\ldots,[l_x,r_x]$$$. The beauty of the painting is the sum of $$$a_{l_i,r_i}$$$ over all $$$1 \\le i \\le x$$$. In the image above, the maximal contiguous intervals of painted cells are $$$[2,4],[6,6],[8,9]$$$ and the beauty of the painting is $$$a_{2,4}+a_{6,6}+a_{8,9}$$$. There are $$$2^n$$$ ways to paint the strip. Help Elsie find the $$$k$$$ largest possible values of the beauty of a painting she can obtain, among all these ways. Note that these $$$k$$$ values do not necessarily have to be distinct. It is guaranteed that there are at least $$$k$$$ different ways to paint the canvas.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^3$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq \\min(2^n, 5 \\cdot 10^3)$$$) — the number of cells and the number of largest values of the beauty of a painting you must find. The next $$$n$$$ lines of each test case describe $$$a$$$ where the $$$i$$$-th of which contains $$$n-i+1$$$ integers $$$a_{i,i},a_{i,i+1},\\ldots,a_{i,n}$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\leq a_{i,j} \\leq 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^3$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^3$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$k$$$ integers in one line: the $$$i$$$-th of them must represent the $$$i$$$-th largest value of the beauty of a painting Elsie can obtain.",
