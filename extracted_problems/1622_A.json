  "statement": "There are three sticks with integer lengths $$$l_1, l_2$$$ and $$$l_3$$$. You are asked to break exactly one of them into two pieces in such a way that: both pieces have positive (strictly greater than $$$0$$$) integer length; the total length of the pieces is equal to the original length of the stick; it's possible to construct a rectangle from the resulting four sticks such that each stick is used as exactly one of its sides. A square is also considered a rectangle. Determine if it's possible to do that.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The only line of each testcase contains three integers $$$l_1, l_2, l_3$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le 10^8$$$) — the lengths of the sticks.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print \" YES \" if it's possible to break one of the sticks into two pieces with positive integer length in such a way that it's possible to construct a rectangle from the resulting four sticks. Otherwise, print \" NO \". You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES are all recognized as a positive answer).",
