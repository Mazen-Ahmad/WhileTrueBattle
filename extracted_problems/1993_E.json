  "statement": "Given a matrix $$$a$$$ of size $$$n \\times m$$$, each cell of which contains a non-negative integer. The integer lying at the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column of the matrix is called $$$a_{i,j}$$$. Let's define $$$f(i)$$$ and $$$g(j)$$$ as the XOR of all integers in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column, respectively. In one operation, you can either: Select any row $$$i$$$, then assign $$$a_{i,j} := g(j)$$$ for each $$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$; or Select any column $$$j$$$, then assign $$$a_{i,j} := f(i)$$$ for each $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. An example of applying an operation on column $$$2$$$ of the matrix. In this example, as we apply an operation on column $$$2$$$, all elements in this column are changed: $$$a_{1,2} := f(1) = a_{1,1} \\oplus a_{1,2} \\oplus a_{1,3} \\oplus a_{1,4} = 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 = 0$$$ $$$a_{2,2} := f(2) = a_{2,1} \\oplus a_{2,2} \\oplus a_{2,3} \\oplus a_{2,4} = 2 \\oplus 3 \\oplus 5 \\oplus 7 = 3$$$ $$$a_{3,2} := f(3) = a_{3,1} \\oplus a_{3,2} \\oplus a_{3,3} \\oplus a_{3,4} = 2 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 3 \\oplus 0 = 1$$$ $$$a_{4,2} := f(4) = a_{4,1} \\oplus a_{4,2} \\oplus a_{4,3} \\oplus a_{4,4} = 10 \\oplus 11 \\oplus 12 \\oplus 16 = 29$$$ You can apply the operations any number of times. Then, we calculate the $$$\\textit{beauty}$$$ of the final matrix by summing the absolute differences between all pairs of its adjacent cells. More formally, $$$\\textit{beauty}(a) = \\sum|a_{x,y} - a_{r,c}|$$$ for all cells $$$(x, y)$$$ and $$$(r, c)$$$ if they are adjacent. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side. Find the minimum $$$\\textit{beauty}$$$ among all obtainable matrices.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 250$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 15$$$) — the number of rows and columns of $$$a$$$, respectively. The next $$$n$$$ lines, each containing $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\ldots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_{i,j} < 2^{20}$$$) — description of the matrix $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$(n^2 + m^2)$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer $$$b$$$ — the smallest possible $$$\\textit{beauty}$$$ of the matrix.",
