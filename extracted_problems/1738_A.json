  "statement": "The hero is addicted to glory, and is fighting against a monster. The hero has $$$n$$$ skills. The $$$i$$$-th skill is of type $$$a_i$$$ (either fire or frost ) and has initial damage $$$b_i$$$. The hero can perform all of the $$$n$$$ skills in any order (with each skill performed exactly once ). When performing each skill, the hero can play a magic as follows: If the current skill immediately follows another skill of a different type, then its damage is doubled . In other words, If a skill of type fire and with initial damage $$$c$$$ is performed immediately after a skill of type fire, then it will deal $$$c$$$ damage; If a skill of type fire and with initial damage $$$c$$$ is performed immediately after a skill of type frost, then it will deal $$$2c$$$ damage; If a skill of type frost and with initial damage $$$c$$$ is performed immediately after a skill of type fire, then it will deal $$$2c$$$ damage; If a skill of type frost and with initial damage $$$c$$$ is performed immediately after a skill of type frost , then it will deal $$$c$$$ damage. Your task is to find the maximum damage the hero can deal.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$), indicating the number of skills. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 1$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ indicates the type of the $$$i$$$-th skill. Specifically, the $$$i$$$-th skill is of type fire if $$$a_i = 0$$$, and of type frost if $$$a_i = 1$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$), where $$$b_i$$$ indicates the initial damage of the $$$i$$$-th skill. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
