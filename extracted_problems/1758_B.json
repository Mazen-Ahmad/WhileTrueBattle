  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$. Find a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$ for all $$$i$$$ and $$$$$$a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_n = \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_n}{n},$$$$$$ where $$$\\oplus$$$ represents the bitwise XOR . It can be proven that there exists a sequence of integers that satisfies all the conditions above.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence you have to find. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ satisfying the conditions in the statement. If there are several possible answers, you can output any of them.",
