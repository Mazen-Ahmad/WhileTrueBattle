  "statement": "ΩΩPARTS - Camellia ⠀ Farmer John has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He also has a function $$$f$$$ with the following recurrence: $$$f(1) = \\sqrt{a_1}$$$; For all $$$i > 1$$$, $$$f(i) = \\sqrt{f(i-1)+a_i}$$$. Note that $$$f(i)$$$ is not necessarily an integer. He plans to do $$$q$$$ updates to the array. Each update, he gives you two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$ and he wants you to set $$$a_k = x$$$. After each update, he wants to know $$$\\lfloor f(n) \\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor t \\rfloor$$$ denotes the value of $$$t$$$ rounded down to the nearest integer.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), the length of $$$a$$$ and the number of updates he will perform. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^{18}$$$). The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x \\leq 10^{18}$$$), the index of the update and the element he will replace $$$a_k$$$ with.",
  "outputFormat": "For each update, output an integer, $$$\\lfloor f(n) \\rfloor$$$, on a new line.",
