  "statement": "Man, this Genshin boss is so hard. Good thing they have a top-up of $$$6$$$ coins for only $$$ \\$4.99$$$. I should be careful and spend no more than I need to, lest my mom catches me... You are fighting a monster with $$$z$$$ health using a weapon with $$$d$$$ damage. Initially, $$$d=0$$$. You can perform the following operations. Increase $$$d$$$ — the damage of your weapon by $$$1$$$, costing $$$x$$$ coins. Attack the monster, dealing $$$d$$$ damage and costing $$$y$$$ coins. You cannot perform the first operation for more than $$$k$$$ times in a row. Find the minimum number of coins needed to defeat the monster by dealing at least $$$z$$$ damage.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains 4 integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\leq x, y, z, k\\leq 10^8$$$) — the first operation's cost, the second operation's cost, the monster's health, and the limitation on the first operation.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum number of coins needed to defeat the monster.",
