  "statement": "You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Array $$$a$$$ contains each odd integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$ in an arbitrary order, and array $$$b$$$ contains each even integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$ in an arbitrary order. You can perform the following operation on those arrays: choose one of the two arrays pick an index $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ swap the $$$i$$$-th and the $$$(i+1)$$$-th elements of the chosen array Compute the minimum number of operations needed to make array $$$a$$$ lexicographically smaller than array $$$b$$$. For two different arrays $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ of the same length $$$n$$$, we say that $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$y$$$ if in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, the array $$$x$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the arrays. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2n$$$, all $$$a_i$$$ are odd and pairwise distinct) — array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 2n$$$, all $$$b_i$$$ are even and pairwise distinct) — array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer: the minimum number of operations needed to make array $$$a$$$ lexicographically smaller than array $$$b$$$. We can show that an answer always exists.",
