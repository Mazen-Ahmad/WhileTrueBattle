  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$. Grasshopper starts in a point $$$0$$$ on an OX axis. In one move, it can jump some integer distance, that is not divisible by $$$k$$$ , to the left or to the right. What's the smallest number of moves it takes the grasshopper to reach point $$$x$$$? What are these moves? If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases. The only line of each testcase contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le 100$$$; $$$2 \\le k \\le 100$$$) — the endpoint and the constraint on the jumps, respectively.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, in the first line, print a single integer $$$n$$$ — the smallest number of moves it takes the grasshopper to reach point $$$x$$$. In the second line, print $$$n$$$ integers, each of them not divisible by $$$k$$$. A positive integer would mean jumping to the right, a negative integer would mean jumping to the left. The endpoint after the jumps should be exactly $$$x$$$. Each jump distance should be from $$$-10^9$$$ to $$$10^9$$$. In can be shown that, for any solution with the smallest number of jumps, there exists a solution with the same number of jumps such that each jump is from $$$-10^9$$$ to $$$10^9$$$. It can be shown that the answer always exists under the given constraints. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
