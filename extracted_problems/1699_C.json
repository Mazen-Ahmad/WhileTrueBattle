  "statement": "You are given a permutation $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ of integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$. Your task is to find how many permutations $$$b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n$$$ are similar to permutation $$$a$$$. Two permutations $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$ are considered similar if for all intervals $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$), the following condition is satisfied: $$$$$$\\operatorname{MEX}([a_l,a_{l+1},\\ldots,a_r])=\\operatorname{MEX}([b_l,b_{l+1},\\ldots,b_r]),$$$$$$ where the $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of a collection of integers $$$c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_k$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in collection $$$c$$$. For example, $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([1,2,3,4,5])=0$$$, and $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([0,1,2,4,5])=3$$$. Since the total number of such permutations can be very large, you will have to print its remainder modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. In this problem, a permutation of size $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[1,0,2,4,3]$$$ is a permutation, while $$$[0,1,1]$$$ is not, since $$$1$$$ appears twice in the array. $$$[0,1,3]$$$ is also not a permutation, since $$$n=3$$$ and there is a $$$3$$$ in the array.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the size of permutation $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\lt n$$$) — the elements of permutation $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer, the number of permutations similar to permutation $$$a$$$, taken modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
