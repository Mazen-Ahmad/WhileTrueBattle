  "statement": "Consider a deck of $$$n$$$ cards. The positions in the deck are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom. A joker is located at position $$$m$$$. $$$q$$$ operations are applied sequentially to the deck. During the $$$i$$$-th operation, you need to take the card at position $$$a_i$$$ and move it either to the beginning or to the end of the deck. For example, if the deck is $$$[2, 1, 3, 5, 4]$$$, and $$$a_i=2$$$, then after the operation the deck will be either $$$[1, 2, 3, 5, 4]$$$ (the card from the second position moved to the beginning) or $$$[2, 3, 5, 4, 1]$$$ (the card from the second position moved to the end). Your task is to calculate the number of distinct positions where the joker can be after each operation.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le n$$$; $$$1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_q$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$q$$$ integers — the number of distinct positions where the joker can be after each operation.",
