  "statement": "In Bobritto Bandito's home town of residence, there are an infinite number of houses on an infinite number line, with houses at $$$\\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$$$. On day $$$0$$$, he started a plague by giving an infection to the unfortunate residents of house $$$0$$$. Each succeeding day, the plague spreads to exactly one healthy household that is next to an infected household. It can be shown that each day the infected houses form a continuous segment. Let the segment starting at the $$$l$$$-th house and ending at the $$$r$$$-th house be denoted as $$$[l, r]$$$. You know that after $$$n$$$ days, the segment $$$[l, r]$$$ became infected. Find any such segment $$$[l', r']$$$ that could have been infected on the $$$m$$$-th day ($$$m \\le n$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) â€“ the number of independent test cases. The only line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$l$$$, and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m\\leq n \\leq 2000, -n \\leq l \\leq 0 \\leq r \\leq n, r-l=n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output two integers $$$l'$$$ and $$$r'$$$ on a new line. If there are multiple solutions, output any.",
