  "statement": "Alex thinks some array is good if there exists some element that can be represented as the sum of all other elements (the sum of all other elements is $$$0$$$ if there are no other elements). For example, the array $$$[1,6,3,2]$$$ is good since $$$1+3+2=6$$$. Furthermore, the array $$$[0]$$$ is also good. However, the arrays $$$[1,2,3,4]$$$ and $$$[1]$$$ are not good. Alex has an array $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$. Help him count the number of good non-empty prefixes of the array $$$a$$$. In other words, count the number of integers $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) such that the length $$$i$$$ prefix (i.e. $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_i$$$) is good.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
