  "statement": "Pak Chanek has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. Since he is currently learning how to calculate the floored average of two numbers, he wants to practice it on his array $$$a$$$. While the array $$$a$$$ has at least two elements, Pak Chanek will perform the following three-step operation: Pick two different indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq |a|$$$; $$$i \\neq j$$$), note that $$$|a|$$$ denotes the current size of the array $$$a$$$. Append $$$\\lfloor \\frac{a_i+a_j}{2} \\rfloor$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ to the end of the array. Remove elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ from the array and concatenate the remaining parts of the array. For example, suppose that $$$a=[5,4,3,2,1,1]$$$. If we choose $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=5$$$, the resulting array will be $$$a=[4,3,2,1,3]$$$. If we choose $$$i=4$$$ and $$$j=3$$$, the resulting array will be $$$a=[5,4,1,1,2]$$$. After all operations, the array will consist of a single element $$$x$$$. Find the maximum possible value of $$$x$$$ if Pak Chanek performs the operations optimally. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the floor function of $$$x$$$, which is the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $$$x$$$. For example, $$$\\lfloor 6 \\rfloor = 6$$$, $$$\\lfloor 2.5 \\rfloor=2$$$, $$$\\lfloor -3.6 \\rfloor=-4$$$ and $$$\\lfloor \\pi \\rfloor=3$$$",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. Do note that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is not bounded.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible value of $$$x$$$ after all numbers have been picked.",
