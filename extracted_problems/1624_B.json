  "statement": "Polycarp has $$$3$$$ positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$. He can perform the following operation exactly once . Choose a positive integer $$$m$$$ and multiply exactly one of the integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ or $$$c$$$ by $$$m$$$. Can Polycarp make it so that after performing the operation, the sequence of three numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ( in this order ) forms an arithmetic progression ? Note that you cannot change the order of $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$. Formally, a sequence $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$ is called an arithmetic progression (AP) if there exists a number $$$d$$$ (called \"common difference\") such that $$$x_{i+1}=x_i+d$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. In this problem, $$$n=3$$$. For example, the following sequences are AP: $$$[5, 10, 15]$$$, $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 1, 1]$$$, and $$$[13, 10, 7]$$$. The following sequences are not AP: $$$[1, 2, 4]$$$, $$$[0, 1, 0]$$$ and $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. You need to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains $$$3$$$ integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b, c \\le 10^8$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print \"YES\" (without quotes) if Polycarp can choose a positive integer $$$m$$$ and multiply exactly one of the integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ or $$$c$$$ by $$$m$$$ to make $$$[a, b, c]$$$ be an arithmetic progression. Print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print YES and NO in any (upper or lower) case (for example, the strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive answer).",
