  "statement": "You have an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. On the $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$d$$$ days you are going to do exactly one of the following two actions: Add $$$1$$$ to each of the first $$$b_i$$$ elements of the array $$$a$$$ (i.e., set $$$a_j := a_j + 1$$$ for each $$$1 \\le j \\le b_i$$$). Count the elements which are equal to their position (i.e., the $$$a_j = j$$$). Denote the number of such elements as $$$c$$$. Then, you add $$$c$$$ to your score, and reset the entire array $$$a$$$ to a $$$0$$$-array of length $$$n$$$ (i.e., set $$$[a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n] := [0, 0, \\ldots, 0]$$$). Your score is equal to $$$0$$$ in the beginning. Note that on each day you should perform exactly one of the actions above: you cannot skip a day or perform both actions on the same day. What is the maximum score you can achieve at the end? Since $$$d$$$ can be quite large, the sequence $$$b$$$ is given to you in the compressed format: You are given a sequence of integers $$$v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k$$$. The sequence $$$b$$$ is a concatenation of infinitely many copies of $$$v$$$: $$$b = [v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k, v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k, \\ldots]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2000$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^5$$$, $$$k \\le d \\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$, the length of the sequence $$$v$$$ and the number of days you are going to perform operations on. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le v_i \\le n$$$) — the sequence $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2000$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer: the maximum score you can achieve at the end of the $$$d$$$-th day.",
