  "statement": "Alice and Bob are playing an infinite game consisting of sets . Each set consists of rounds . In each round, one of the players wins. The first player to win two rounds in a set wins this set. Thus, a set always ends with the score of $$$2:0$$$ or $$$2:1$$$ in favor of one of the players. Let's call a game scenario a finite string $$$s$$$ consisting of characters ' a ' and ' b '. Consider an infinite string formed with repetitions of string $$$s$$$: $$$sss \\ldots$$$ Suppose that Alice and Bob play rounds according to this infinite string, left to right. If a character of the string $$$sss \\ldots$$$ is ' a ', then Alice wins the round; if it's ' b ', Bob wins the round. As soon as one of the players wins two rounds, the set ends in their favor, and a new set starts from the next round. Let's define $$$a_i$$$ as the number of sets won by Alice among the first $$$i$$$ sets while playing according to the given scenario. Let's also define $$$r$$$ as the limit of ratio $$$\\frac{a_i}{i}$$$ as $$$i \\rightarrow \\infty$$$. If $$$r > \\frac{1}{2}$$$, we'll say that scenario $$$s$$$ is winning for Alice . If $$$r = \\frac{1}{2}$$$, we'll say that scenario $$$s$$$ is tied . If $$$r < \\frac{1}{2}$$$, we'll say that scenario $$$s$$$ is winning for Bob . You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of characters ' a ', ' b ', and ' ? '. Consider all possible ways of replacing every ' ? ' with ' a ' or ' b ' to obtain a string consisting only of characters ' a ' and ' b '. Count how many of them result in a scenario winning for Alice, how many result in a tied scenario, and how many result in a scenario winning for Bob. Print these three numbers modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",

  "outputFormat": "Print three integers: how many ways result in a scenario winning for Alice, how many result in a tied scenario, and how many result in a scenario winning for Bob, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
