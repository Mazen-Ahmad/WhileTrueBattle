  "statement": "Monsters have invaded the town again! Asuka invites her good friend, Jellyfish, to drive EVA with her. There are $$$n$$$ cities in the town. All the monsters are in city $$$n$$$. Jellyfish and Asuka are currently in city $$$1$$$ and need to move to city $$$n$$$ to defeat the monsters. There are $$$m$$$ roads. The $$$i$$$-th road allows one to travel from city $$$a_i$$$ to city $$$b_i$$$. All the roads are directed . That is, one cannot travel from city $$$b_i$$$ to $$$a_i$$$ using the $$$i$$$-th road. Interestingly, all roads satisfy $$$a_i<b_i$$$. Driving EVA requires two people to work together. However, Asuka and Jellyfish have not done any training together before. Suppose that EVA is currently in city $$$u$$$. Jellyfish and Asuka will both choose an undestroyed road that starts at city $$$u$$$. Suppose Jellyfish and Asuka choose roads that end at cities $$$v_1$$$ and $$$v_2$$$ respectively. If $$$v_1 = v_2$$$, EVA moves to city $$$v_1$$$ successfully. Otherwise, EVA stays in city $$$u$$$ and both roads that they have chosen will be destroyed. It is possible that EVA is currently in city $$$u$$$ ($$$u \\neq n$$$) and there are no undestroyed roads that start at city $$$u$$$. In that case, the mission will be a failure. Otherwise, if they reach city $$$n$$$ in the end, the mission is considered a success. Every time they choose the roads, Jellyfish knows that Asuka will choose a road randomly. Now, Jellyfish wants to know, if she chooses the roads optimally, what is the maximum probability of the mission being successful.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 5000$$$, $$$0 \\leq m \\leq \\min(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \\cdot 10^5)$$$) — the number of the cities and the number of the roads. In the following $$$m$$$ lines of each test case, each line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a < b \\leq n$$$) — representing a road from city $$$a$$$ to city $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that for each test case, each road appears at most once. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$5000$$$ and that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Output the maximum probability of the mission being successful if Jellyfish chooses the roads optimally. Your answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-9}$$$. Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is considered correct if $$$\\frac{|a-b|}{\\max(1,|b|)} \\leq 10^{-9}$$$.",
