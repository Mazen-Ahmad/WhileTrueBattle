  "statement": "You are given two arrays: an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ zeros and an array $$$b$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You can apply the following operation to the array $$$a$$$ an arbitrary number of times: choose some subsegment of $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ and add the arithmetic progression $$$1, 2, \\ldots, k$$$ to this subsegment — i. e. add $$$1$$$ to the first element of the subsegment, $$$2$$$ to the second element, and so on. The chosen subsegment should be inside the borders of the array $$$a$$$ (i.e., if the left border of the chosen subsegment is $$$l$$$, then the condition $$$1 \\le l \\le l + k - 1 \\le n$$$ should be satisfied). Note that the progression added is always $$$1, 2, \\ldots, k$$$ but not the $$$k, k - 1, \\ldots, 1$$$ or anything else (i.e., the leftmost element of the subsegment always increases by $$$1$$$, the second element always increases by $$$2$$$ and so on). Your task is to find the minimum possible number of operations required to satisfy the condition $$$a_i \\ge b_i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Note that the condition $$$a_i \\ge b_i$$$ should be satisfied for all elements at once.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in both arrays and the length of the subsegment, respectively. The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^{12}$$$), where $$$b_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of the array $$$b$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer — the minimum possible number of operations required to satisfy the condition $$$a_i \\ge b_i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.",
