  "statement": "green_gold_dog has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, and he wants to find a permutation $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that the number of distinct numbers in the element-wise difference between array $$$a$$$ and permutation $$$b$$$ is maximized. A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in any order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation (as $$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation (as $$$n=3$$$, but $$$4$$$ appears in the array). The element-wise difference between two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is an array $$$c$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where $$$c_i$$$ = $$$a_i - b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 4 \\cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 4 \\cdot 10^4$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \\cdot 10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ numbers - a suitable permutation $$$b$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
