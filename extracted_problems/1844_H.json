  "statement": "An array $$$a_1,\\dots,a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is initially all blank. There are $$$n$$$ updates where one entry of $$$a$$$ is updated to some number, such that $$$a$$$ becomes a permutation of $$$1,2,\\dots,n$$$ after all the updates. After each update, find the number of ways (modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$) to fill in the remaining blank entries of $$$a$$$ so that $$$a$$$ becomes a permutation of $$$1,2,\\dots,n$$$ and all cycle lengths in $$$a$$$ are multiples of $$$3$$$. A permutation of $$$1,2,\\dots,n$$$ is an array of length $$$n$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. A cycle in a permutation $$$a$$$ is a sequence of pairwise distinct integers $$$(i_1,\\dots,i_k)$$$ such that $$$i_2 = a_{i_1},i_3 = a_{i_2},\\dots,i_k = a_{i_{k-1}},i_1 = a_{i_k}$$$. The length of this cycle is the number $$$k$$$, which is a multiple of $$$3$$$ if and only if $$$k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$$$). The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$, representing that the $$$i$$$-th update changes $$$a_{x_i}$$$ to $$$y_i$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$x_1,\\dots,x_n$$$ and $$$y_1,\\dots,y_n$$$ are permutations of $$$1,2,\\dots,n$$$, i.e. $$$a$$$ becomes a permutation of $$$1,2,\\dots,n$$$ after all the updates.",
