  "statement": "A matrix is called quaternary if all its elements are $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, or $$$3$$$. Ecrade calls a quaternary matrix $$$A$$$ good if the following two properties hold. The bitwise XOR of all numbers in each row of matrix $$$A$$$ is equal to $$$0$$$. The bitwise XOR of all numbers in each column of matrix $$$A$$$ is equal to $$$0$$$. Ecrade has a quaternary matrix of size $$$n \\times m$$$. He is interested in the minimum number of elements that need to be changed for the matrix to become good , and he also wants to find one of the possible resulting matrices. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 10^3$$$). This is followed by $$$n$$$ lines, each containing exactly $$$m$$$ characters and consisting only of $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$, describing the elements of Ecrade's matrix. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n\\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the minimum number of elements that need to be changed for the matrix to become good on the first line, then print $$$n$$$ lines, each containing exactly $$$m$$$ characters and consisting only of $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$, describing one of the possible resulting matrices. If there are multiple possible resulting matrices, output any of them.",
