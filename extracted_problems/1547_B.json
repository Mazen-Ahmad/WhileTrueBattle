  "statement": "A string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 26$$$) is called alphabetical if it can be obtained using the following algorithm: first, write an empty string to $$$s$$$ (i.e. perform the assignment $$$s$$$ := \"\" ); then perform the next step $$$n$$$ times; at the $$$i$$$-th step take $$$i$$$-th lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet and write it either to the left of the string $$$s$$$ or to the right of the string $$$s$$$ (i.e. perform the assignment $$$s$$$ := $$$c+s$$$ or $$$s$$$ := $$$s+c$$$, where $$$c$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th letter of the Latin alphabet). In other words, iterate over the $$$n$$$ first letters of the Latin alphabet starting from ' a ' and etc. Each time we prepend a letter to the left of the string $$$s$$$ or append a letter to the right of the string $$$s$$$. Strings that can be obtained in that way are alphabetical. For example, the following strings are alphabetical: \" a \", \" ba \", \" ab \", \" bac \" and \" ihfcbadeg \". The following strings are not alphabetical: \" z \", \" aa \", \" ca \", \" acb \", \" xyz \" and \" ddcba \". From the given string, determine if it is alphabetical.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case is written on a separate line that contains one string $$$s$$$. String $$$s$$$ consists of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet and has a length between $$$1$$$ and $$$26$$$, inclusive.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$t$$$ lines, each of them must contain the answer to the corresponding test case. Output YES if the given string $$$s$$$ is alphabetical and NO otherwise. You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive answer).",
