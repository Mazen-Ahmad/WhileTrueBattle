  "statement": "You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$. You need to make it beautiful with the least amount of operations. Before applying operations, you can shuffle the array elements as you like. For one operation, you can do the following: Choose an index $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, Make $$$a_i = a_i + k$$$. The array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ is beautiful if $$$b_i = b_{n - i + 1}$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the array beautiful, or report that it is impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of sets of input data. Then follows their description. The first line of each set of input data contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$ and the number $$$k$$$ from the problem statement. The second line of each set of input data contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all sets of input data does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each set of input data, output the minimum number of operations needed to make the array beautiful, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.",
