  "statement": "You are given a program that consists of $$$n$$$ instructions. Initially a single variable $$$x$$$ is assigned to $$$0$$$. Afterwards, the instructions are of two types: increase $$$x$$$ by $$$1$$$; decrease $$$x$$$ by $$$1$$$. You are given $$$m$$$ queries of the following format: query $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ — how many distinct values is $$$x$$$ assigned to if all the instructions between the $$$l$$$-th one and the $$$r$$$-th one inclusive are ignored and the rest are executed without changing the order?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases. Then the description of $$$t$$$ testcases follows. The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of instructions in the program and the number of queries. The second line of each testcase contains a program — a string of $$$n$$$ characters: each character is either ' + ' or ' - ' — increment and decrement instruction, respectively. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) — the description of the query. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. The sum of $$$m$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase print $$$m$$$ integers — for each query $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ print the number of distinct values variable $$$x$$$ is assigned to if all the instructions between the $$$l$$$-th one and the $$$r$$$-th one inclusive are ignored and the rest are executed without changing the order.",
