  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. Kevin has $$$n$$$ classmates, numbered $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Any two of them may either be friends or not friends. Kevin wants to select $$$2k$$$ classmates to form $$$k$$$ teams, where each team contains exactly $$$2$$$ people. Each person can belong to at most one team. Let $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ be two people in the $$$i$$$-th team. To avoid potential conflicts during team formation, the team members must satisfy one of the following two conditions: For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\leq i \\leq k$$$), classmate $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ are friends. For all $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\leq i \\leq k$$$), classmate $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ are not friends. Kevin wants to determine the maximum $$$k$$$ such that, regardless of the friendship relationships among the $$$n$$$ people, he can always find $$$2k$$$ people to form the teams. After that, he needs to form $$$k$$$ teams. But asking whether two classmates are friends is awkward, so Kevin wants to achieve this while asking about the friendship status of no more than $$$n$$$ pairs of classmates. The interactor is adaptive . It means that the hidden relationship between classmates is not fixed before the interaction and will change during the interaction.",
