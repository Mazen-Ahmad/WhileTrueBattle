  "statement": "Alice and Bob play the following game. Alice has a set $$$S$$$ of disjoint ranges of integers, initially containing only one range $$$[1, n]$$$. In one turn, Alice picks a range $$$[l, r]$$$ from the set $$$S$$$ and asks Bob to pick a number in the range. Bob chooses a number $$$d$$$ ($$$l \\le d \\le r$$$). Then Alice removes $$$[l, r]$$$ from $$$S$$$ and puts into the set $$$S$$$ the range $$$[l, d - 1]$$$ (if $$$l \\le d - 1$$$) and the range $$$[d + 1, r]$$$ (if $$$d + 1 \\le r$$$). The game ends when the set $$$S$$$ is empty. We can show that the number of turns in each game is exactly $$$n$$$. After playing the game, Alice remembers all the ranges $$$[l, r]$$$ she picked from the set $$$S$$$, but Bob does not remember any of the numbers that he picked. But Bob is smart, and he knows he can find out his numbers $$$d$$$ from Alice's ranges, and so he asks you for help with your programming skill. Given the list of ranges that Alice has picked ($$$[l, r]$$$), for each range, help Bob find the number $$$d$$$ that Bob has picked. We can show that there is always a unique way for Bob to choose his number for a list of valid ranges picked by Alice.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$). Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$), denoting the range $$$[l, r]$$$ that Alice picked at some point. Note that the ranges are given in no particular order . It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$, and the ranges for each test case are from a valid game.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print $$$n$$$ lines. Each line should contain three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$d$$$, denoting that for Alice's range $$$[l, r]$$$ Bob picked the number $$$d$$$. You can print the lines in any order . We can show that the answer is unique. It is not required to print a new line after each test case. The new lines in the output of the example are for readability only.",
