  "statement": "I see satyam343. I'm shaking. Please more median problems this time. I love those. Please satyam343 we believe in you. — satyam343's biggest fan You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$. You are also given a binary array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation at most $$$k$$$ times: Select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) such that $$$b_i = 1$$$. Set $$$a_i = a_i + 1$$$ (i.e., increase $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$). Your score is defined to be $$$\\max\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \\left( a_i + \\operatorname{median}(c_i) \\right)$$$, where $$$c_i$$$ denotes the array of length $$$n-1$$$ that you get by deleting $$$a_i$$$ from $$$a$$$. In other words, your score is the maximum value of $$$a_i + \\operatorname{median}(c_i)$$$ over all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Find the maximum score that you can achieve if you perform the operations optimally. For an arbitrary array $$$p$$$, $$$\\operatorname{median}(p)$$$ is defined as the $$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{|p|+1}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$$-th smallest element of $$$p$$$. For example, $$$\\operatorname{median} \\left( [3,2,1,3] \\right) = 2$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{median} \\left( [6,2,4,5,1] \\right) = 4$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case begins with two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the $$$a$$$ and the number of operations you can perform. The following line contains $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — denoting the array $$$a$$$. The following line contains $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$b_i$$$ is $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$) — denoting the array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
