  "statement": "You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements, each element is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. You can make operations of $$$2$$$ kinds. Pick an index $$$i$$$ and change $$$a_i$$$ to $$$1-a_i$$$. Rearrange the array $$$a$$$ however you want. Find the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 400$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the length of the arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$a_i$$$ is $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$), representing the array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n$$$ ($$$b_i$$$ is $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$), representing the array $$$b$$$.",
