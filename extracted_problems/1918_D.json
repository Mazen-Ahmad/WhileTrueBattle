  "statement": "You are given an array of numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Your task is to block some elements of the array in order to minimize its cost. Suppose you block the elements with indices $$$1 \\leq b_1 < b_2 < \\ldots < b_m \\leq n$$$. Then the cost of the array is calculated as the maximum of: the sum of the blocked elements, i.e., $$$a_{b_1} + a_{b_2} + \\ldots + a_{b_m}$$$. the maximum sum of the segments into which the array is divided when the blocked elements are removed. That is, the maximum sum of the following ($$$m + 1$$$) subarrays: [$$$1, b_1 − 1$$$], [$$$b_1 + 1, b_2 − 1$$$], [$$$\\ldots$$$], [$$$b_{m−1} + 1, b_m - 1$$$], [$$$b_m + 1, n$$$] (the sum of numbers in a subarray of the form [$$$x,x − 1$$$] is considered to be $$$0$$$). For example, if $$$n = 6$$$, the original array is [$$$1, 4, 5, 3, 3, 2$$$], and you block the elements at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$, then the cost of the array will be the maximum of the sum of the blocked elements ($$$4 + 3 = 7$$$) and the sums of the subarrays ($$$1$$$, $$$5 + 3 = 8$$$, $$$2$$$), which is $$$\\max(7,1,8,2) = 8$$$. You need to output the minimum cost of the array after blocking.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 30\\,000$$$) — the number of queries. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ elements $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single number — the minimum cost of blocking the array.",
