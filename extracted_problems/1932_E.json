  "statement": "You are in a nuclear laboratory that is about to explode and destroy the Earth. You must save the Earth before the final countdown reaches zero. The countdown consists of $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 4 \\cdot 10^5$$$) mechanical indicators, each showing one decimal digit. You noticed that when the countdown changes its state from $$$x$$$ to $$$x-1$$$, it doesn't happen in one move. Instead, each change of a single digit takes one second. So, for example, if the countdown shows 42 , then it will change to 41 in one second, because only one digit is changed, but if the countdown shows 2300 , then it will change to 2299 in three seconds, because the three last digits are changed. Find out how much time is left before the countdown reaches zero.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 4\\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains a string of $$$n$$$ digits, the current state of the countdown. It is guaranteed that at least one digit is not zero. The sum of $$$n$$$ for all tests does not exceed $$$4\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer without leading zeroes, the number of seconds left before the countdown reaches zero. Note that this number may be huge.",
