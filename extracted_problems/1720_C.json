  "statement": "You are given a matrix consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. Each cell of this matrix contains $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. Let's call a square of size $$$2 \\times 2$$$ without one corner cell an L-shape figure. In one operation you can take one L-shape figure, with at least one cell containing $$$1$$$ and replace all numbers in it with zeroes. Find the maximum number of operations that you can do with the given matrix.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of each test case. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n, m \\leq 500$$$) — the size of the matrix. Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains a binary string of length $$$m$$$ — the description of the matrix. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output the maximum number of operations you can do with the given matrix.",
