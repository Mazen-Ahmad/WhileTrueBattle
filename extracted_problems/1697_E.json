  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ points on the plane, the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point are $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. No two points have the same coordinates. The distance between points $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ is defined as $$$d(i,j) = |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|$$$. For each point, you have to choose a color, represented by an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. For every ordered triple of different points $$$(a,b,c)$$$, the following constraints should be met: if $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ have the same color, then $$$d(a,b) = d(a,c) = d(b,c)$$$; if $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same color, and the color of $$$c$$$ is different from the color of $$$a$$$, then $$$d(a,b) < d(a,c)$$$ and $$$d(a,b) < d(b,c)$$$. Calculate the number of different ways to choose the colors that meet these constraints.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of points. Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^8$$$). No two points have the same coordinates (i. e. if $$$i \\ne j$$$, then either $$$x_i \\ne x_j$$$ or $$$y_i \\ne y_j$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer — the number of ways to choose the colors for the points. Since it can be large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
