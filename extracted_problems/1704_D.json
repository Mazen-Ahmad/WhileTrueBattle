  "statement": "Eric has an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$, then he generates $$$n$$$ additional arrays $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$, each of length $$$m$$$, from the array $$$b$$$, by the following way: Initially, $$$c_i = b$$$ for every $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. Eric secretly chooses an integer $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \\le k \\le n)$$$ and chooses $$$c_k$$$ to be the special array. There are two operations that Eric can perform on an array $$$c_t$$$: Operation 1 : Choose two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$2 \\leq i < j \\leq m-1$$$), subtract $$$1$$$ from both $$$c_t[i]$$$ and $$$c_t[j]$$$, and add $$$1$$$ to both $$$c_t[i-1]$$$ and $$$c_t[j+1]$$$. That operation can only be used on a non-special array, that is when $$$t \\neq k$$$. ; Operation 2 : Choose two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$2 \\leq i < j \\leq m-2$$$), subtract $$$1$$$ from both $$$c_t[i]$$$ and $$$c_t[j]$$$, and add $$$1$$$ to both $$$c_t[i-1]$$$ and $$$c_t[j+2]$$$. That operation can only be used on a special array, that is when $$$t = k$$$. Note that Eric can't perform an operation if any element of the array will become less than $$$0$$$ after that operation. Now, Eric does the following: For every non-special array $$$c_i$$$ ($$$i \\neq k$$$), Eric uses only operation 1 on it at least once . For the special array $$$c_k$$$, Eric uses only operation 2 on it at least once . Lastly, Eric discards the array $$$b$$$. For given arrays $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$, your task is to find out the special array, i.e. the value $$$k$$$. Also, you need to find the number of times of operation $$$2$$$ was used on it.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$7 \\leq m \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of arrays given to you, and the length of each array. The next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers each, $$$c_{i,1}, c_{i,2}, \\dots , c_{i,m}$$$. It is guaranteed that each element of the discarded array $$$b$$$ is in the range $$$[0,10^6]$$$, and therefore $$$0 \\leq c_{i,j} \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^{11}$$$ for all possible pairs of $$$(i,j)$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$. It is guaranteed that the input is generated according to the procedure above.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one line containing two integers — the index of the special array, and the number of times that Operation 2 was performed on it. It can be shown that under the constraints given in the problem, this value is unique and won't exceed $$$10^{18}$$$, so you can represent it as a $$$64$$$-bit integer. It can also be shown that the index of the special array is uniquely determined. In this problem, hacks are disabled .",
