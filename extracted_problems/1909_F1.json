  "statement": "Andy Tunstall - MiniBoss ⠀ In the easy version, the $$$a_i$$$ are in the range $$$[0, n]$$$; in the hard version, the $$$a_i$$$ are in the range $$$[-1, n]$$$ and the definition of good permutation is slightly different. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved. You are given an integer $$$n$$$ and an array $$$a_1, a_2 \\dots, a_n$$$ of integers in the range $$$[0, n]$$$. A permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$ of $$$[1, 2, \\dots, n]$$$ is good if, for each $$$i$$$, the following condition is true: the number of values $$$\\leq i$$$ in $$$[p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_i]$$$ is exactly $$$a_i$$$. Count the good permutations of $$$[1, 2, \\dots, n]$$$, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le n$$$), which describe the conditions for a good permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing the number of good permutations, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
