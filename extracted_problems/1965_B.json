  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Find a sequence $$$a$$$ of non-negative integers of size at most $$$25$$$ such that the following conditions hold. There is no subsequence of $$$a$$$ with a sum of $$$k$$$. For all $$$1 \\le v \\le n$$$ where $$$v \\ne k$$$, there is a subsequence of $$$a$$$ with a sum of $$$v$$$. A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, $$$[5, 2, 3]$$$ is a subsequence of $$$[1, 5, 7, 8, 2, 4, 3]$$$. It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) — the parameters described above. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^7$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 25$$$) — the size of your chosen sequence. The second line of output for each test case should contain $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of your chosen sequence. If there are multiple solutions, print any.",
