  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$. You have to construct a permutation of size $$$n$$$. A permutation is an array where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$s$$$ (where $$$s$$$ is the size of permutation) occurs exactly once. For example, $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$ is a permutation of size $$$4$$$; $$$[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]$$$ is a permutation of size $$$5$$$; $$$[1, 4, 3]$$$ is not a permutation (the integer $$$2$$$ is absent), $$$[2, 1, 3, 1]$$$ is not a permutation (the integer $$$1$$$ appears twice). A subsegment of a permutation is a contiguous subsequence of that permutation. For example, the permutation $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$ has $$$10$$$ subsegments: $$$[2]$$$, $$$[2, 1]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 4]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$, $$$[1]$$$, $$$[1, 4]$$$, $$$[1, 4, 3]$$$, $$$[4]$$$, $$$[4, 3]$$$ and $$$[3]$$$. The value of the permutation is the number of its subsegments which are also permutations. For example, the value of $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$ is $$$3$$$ since the subsegments $$$[2, 1]$$$, $$$[1]$$$ and $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$ are permutations. You have to construct a permutation of size $$$n$$$ with minimum possible value among all permutations of size $$$n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 48$$$) — the number of test cases. Then, $$$t$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 50$$$) representing the $$$i$$$-th test case.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers — the permutation of size $$$n$$$ with minimum possible value . If there are multiple such permutations, print any of them.",
