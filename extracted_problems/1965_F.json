  "statement": "You have been asked to organize a very important art conference. The first step is to choose the dates. The conference must last for a certain number of consecutive days. Each day, one lecturer must perform, and the same lecturer cannot perform more than once. You asked $$$n$$$ potential lecturers if they could participate in the conference. Lecturer $$$i$$$ indicated that they could perform on any day from $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ inclusive. A certain segment of days can be chosen as the conference dates if there is a way to assign an available lecturer to each day of the segment, assigning each lecturer to no more than one day. For each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, find how many ways there are to choose a segment of $$$k$$$ consecutive days as the conference dates.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains one integer $$$n$$$ — the number of potential lecturers ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ — the segment of available days for the $$$i$$$th lecturer ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$k$$$th number denotes the number of ways to select a segment of $$$k$$$ consecutive days as conference dates.",
