  "statement": "Two T-shirt sizes are given: $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The T-shirt size is either a string M or a string consisting of several (possibly zero) characters X and one of the characters S or L . For example, strings M , XXL , S , XXXXXXXS could be the size of some T-shirts. And the strings XM , LL , SX are not sizes. The letter M stands for medium, S for small, L for large. The letter X refers to the degree of size (from eXtra). For example, XXL is extra-extra-large (bigger than XL , and smaller than XXXL ). You need to compare two given sizes of T-shirts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The T-shirts are compared as follows: any small size (no matter how many letters X ) is smaller than the medium size and any large size; any large size (regardless of the number of letters X ) is larger than the medium size and any small size; the more letters X before S , the smaller the size; the more letters X in front of L , the larger the size. For example: XXXS < XS XXXL > XL XL > M XXL = XXL XXXXXS < M XL > XXXS",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line, in which $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ T-shirt sizes are written. The lengths of the strings corresponding to the T-shirt sizes do not exceed $$$50$$$. It is guaranteed that all sizes are correct.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print on a separate line the result of comparing $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ T-shirt sizes (lines \" < \", \" > \" or \" = \" without quotes).",
