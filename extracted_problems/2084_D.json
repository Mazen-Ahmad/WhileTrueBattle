  "statement": "You are given three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$, where $$$m \\cdot k < n$$$. For a sequence $$$b$$$ consisting of non-negative integers, define $$$f(b)$$$ as follows: You may perform the following operation on $$$b$$$: Let $$$l$$$ denote the current length of $$$b$$$. Choose a positive integer $$$1 \\leq i \\leq l - k + 1$$$, remove the subarray from index $$$i$$$ to $$$i + k - 1$$$ and concatenate the remaining parts. In other words, replace $$$b$$$ with $$$$$$[b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{i - 1}, b_{i + k}, b_{i + k + 1}, \\ldots, b_l].$$$$$$ $$$f(b)$$$ is defined as the minimum possible value of $$$\\operatorname{mex}(b)$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ after performing the above operation at most $$$m$$$ times (possibly zero). You need to construct a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of non-negative integers, such that: For all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$. Over all such sequences $$$a$$$, $$$f(a)$$$ is maximized . $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$c$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le m < n$$$, $$$1 \\le k < n$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\cdot k < n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
