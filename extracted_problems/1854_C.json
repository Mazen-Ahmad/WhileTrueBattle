  "statement": "You have a set $$$S$$$ of $$$n$$$ distinct integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$. Each second you do the following steps: Pick an element $$$x$$$ in $$$S$$$ uniformly at random. Remove $$$x$$$ from $$$S$$$. If $$$x+1 \\leq m$$$ and $$$x+1$$$ is not in $$$S$$$, add $$$x+1$$$ to $$$S$$$. What is the expected number of seconds until $$$S$$$ is empty? Output the answer modulo $$$1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$. Formally, let $$$P = 1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{a}{b}$$$, where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are integers and $$$b \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{P}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$a \\cdot b^{-1} \\bmod P$$$. In other words, output an integer $$$z$$$ such that $$$0 \\le z < P$$$ and $$$z \\cdot b \\equiv a \\pmod{P}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq m \\leq 500$$$) — the number of elements in the set $$$S$$$ and the upper bound on the value of the elements in $$$S$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$S_1,\\,S_2,\\,\\dots,\\,S_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq S_1 < S_2 < \\ldots < S_n \\leq m$$$) — the elements of the set $$$S$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Output a single integer — the expected number of seconds until $$$S$$$ is empty, modulo $$$1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$.",
