  "statement": "You like numbers, don't you? Nastia has a lot of numbers and she wants to share them with you! Isn't it amazing? Let $$$a_i$$$ be how many numbers $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le k$$$) you have. An $$$n \\times n$$$ matrix is called beautiful if it contains all the numbers you have, and for each $$$2 \\times 2$$$ submatrix of the original matrix is satisfied: The number of occupied cells doesn't exceed $$$3$$$; The numbers on each diagonal are distinct. Make a beautiful matrix of minimum size.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le m, k \\le 10^5$$$) — how many numbers Nastia gave you and the length of the array $$$a$$$, respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{k}$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le m$$$, $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{k} = m$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is how many numbers $$$i$$$ you have. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ in one test doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each $$$t$$$ test case print a single integer $$$n$$$ — the size of the beautiful matrix. In the next $$$n$$$ lines print $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_{i, j}$$$ ($$$0 \\le b_{i, j} \\le k$$$; if position is empty, print $$$b_{i, j} = 0$$$) — the beautiful matrix $$$b$$$ you made up.",
