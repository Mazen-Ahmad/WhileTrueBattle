  "statement": "The beauty of an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ is defined as $$$\\max(b_i \\oplus b_j)$$$ among all possible pairs $$$1 \\le i \\le j \\le m$$$, where $$$x \\oplus y$$$ is the bitwise XOR of numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. We denote the beauty value of the array $$$b$$$ as $$$f(b)$$$. An array $$$b$$$ is called beautiful if $$$f(b) \\ge k$$$. Recently, Kostya bought an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ from the store. He considers this array too long, so he plans to cut out some beautiful subarray from it. That is, he wants to choose numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) such that the array $$$a_{l \\dots r}$$$ is beautiful. The length of such a subarray will be the number $$$r - l + 1$$$. The entire array $$$a$$$ is also considered a subarray (with $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = n$$$). Your task is to find the length of the shortest beautiful subarray in the array $$$a$$$. If no subarray is beautiful, you should output the number $$$-1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Next, there are $$$t$$$ blocks of two lines: In the first line of the block, there are two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$). In the second line of the block, there is the array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all tests does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, you need to output a single integer â€” the minimum length of the segment $$$(l, r)$$$ for which $$$f(a_{l \\dots r}) \\ge k$$$. If such a segment is not found, you should output $$$-1$$$.",
