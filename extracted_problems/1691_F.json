  "statement": "You are given a tree $$$G$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices and an integer $$$k$$$. The vertices of the tree are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. For a vertex $$$r$$$ and a subset $$$S$$$ of vertices of $$$G$$$, such that $$$|S| = k$$$, we define $$$f(r, S)$$$ as the size of the smallest rooted subtree containing all vertices in $$$S$$$ when the tree is rooted at $$$r$$$. A set of vertices $$$T$$$ is called a rooted subtree, if all the vertices in $$$T$$$ are connected, and for each vertex in $$$T$$$, all its descendants belong to $$$T$$$. You need to calculate the sum of $$$f(r, S)$$$ over all possible distinct combinations of vertices $$$r$$$ and subsets $$$S$$$, where $$$|S| = k$$$. Formally, compute the following: $$$$$$\\sum_{r \\in V} \\sum_{S \\subseteq V, |S| = k} f(r, S),$$$$$$ where $$$V$$$ is the set of vertices in $$$G$$$. Output the answer modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$). Each of the following $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n$$$), denoting an edge between vertex $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.",
