  "statement": "Parsa has a humongous tree on $$$n$$$ vertices. On each vertex $$$v$$$ he has written two integers $$$l_v$$$ and $$$r_v$$$. To make Parsa's tree look even more majestic, Nima wants to assign a number $$$a_v$$$ ($$$l_v \\le a_v \\le r_v$$$) to each vertex $$$v$$$ such that the beauty of Parsa's tree is maximized. Nima's sense of the beauty is rather bizarre. He defines the beauty of the tree as the sum of $$$|a_u - a_v|$$$ over all edges $$$(u, v)$$$ of the tree. Since Parsa's tree is too large, Nima can't maximize its beauty on his own. Your task is to find the maximum possible beauty for Parsa's tree.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1\\le t\\le 250)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2\\le n\\le 10^5)$$$ — the number of vertices in Parsa's tree. The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ $$$(1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 10^9)$$$. Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ $$$(1 \\le u , v \\le n, u\\neq v)$$$ meaning that there is an edge between the vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in Parsa's tree. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
