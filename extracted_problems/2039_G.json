  "statement": "Shohag has a tree with $$$n$$$ nodes. Pebae has an integer $$$m$$$. She wants to assign each node a value — an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. So she asks Shohag to count the number, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$, of assignments such that following conditions are satisfied: For each pair $$$1 \\le u \\lt v \\le n$$$, the least common multiple (LCM) of the values of the nodes in the unique simple path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ is not divisible by the number of nodes in the path. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the values of all nodes from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is $$$1$$$. But this problem is too hard for Shohag to solve. As Shohag loves Pebae, he has to solve the problem. Please save Shohag!",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 10^{9}$$$). Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$) indicating there is an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer — the number of valid ways to assign each vertex a value, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
