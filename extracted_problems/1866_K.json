  "statement": "There is a tree of $$$N$$$ vertices and $$$N-1$$$ edges. The $$$i$$$-th edge connects vertices $$$U_i$$$ and $$$V_i$$$ and has a length of $$$W_i$$$. Chaneka, the owner of the tree, asks you $$$Q$$$ times. For the $$$j$$$-th question, the following is the question format: $$$X_j$$$ $$$K_j$$$ – If each edge that contains vertex $$$X_j$$$ has its length multiplied by $$$K_j$$$, what is the diameter of the tree? Notes: Each of Chaneka's question is independent , which means the changes in edge length do not influence the next questions. The diameter of a tree is the maximum possible distance between two different vertices in the tree.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$N$$$ ($$$2\\leq N\\leq10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$N-1$$$ lines contains three integers $$$U_i$$$, $$$V_i$$$, and $$$W_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq U_i,V_i \\leq N$$$; $$$1\\leq W_i\\leq10^9$$$) — an edge that connects vertices $$$U_i$$$ and $$$V_i$$$ with a length of $$$W_i$$$. The edges form a tree. The $$$(N+1)$$$-th line contains a single integer $$$Q$$$ ($$$1\\leq Q\\leq10^5$$$) — the number of questions. The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$Q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$X_j$$$ and $$$K_j$$$ as described ($$$1 \\leq X_j \\leq N$$$; $$$1 \\leq K_j \\leq 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$Q$$$ lines with an integer in each line. The integer in the $$$j$$$-th line represents the diameter of the tree on the $$$j$$$-th question.",
