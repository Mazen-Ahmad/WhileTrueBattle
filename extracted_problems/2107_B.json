  "statement": "Tom and Jerry found some apples in the basement. They decided to play a game to get some apples. There are $$$n$$$ boxes, and the $$$i$$$-th box has $$$a_i$$$ apples inside. Tom and Jerry take turns picking up apples. Tom goes first. On their turn, they have to do the following: Choose a box $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) with a positive number of apples, i.e. $$$a_i > 0$$$, and pick $$$1$$$ apple from this box. Note that this reduces $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$. If no valid box exists, the current player loses. If after the move , $$$\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) - \\min(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) > k$$$ holds, then the current player (who made the last move) also loses. If both players play optimally, predict the winner of the game.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5,1\\le k \\le 10^9$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \"Tom\" (without quotes) if Tom will win, or \"Jerry\" (without quotes) otherwise.",
