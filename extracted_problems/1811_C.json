  "statement": "Kristina had an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of non-negative integers. She built a new array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n-1$$$, such that $$$b_i = \\max(a_i, a_{i+1})$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n-1$$$). For example, suppose Kristina had an array $$$a$$$ = [$$$3, 0, 4, 0, 5$$$] of length $$$5$$$. Then she did the following: Calculated $$$b_1 = \\max(a_1, a_2) = \\max(3, 0) = 3$$$; Calculated $$$b_2 = \\max(a_2, a_3) = \\max(0, 4) = 4$$$; Calculated $$$b_3 = \\max(a_3, a_4) = \\max(4, 0) = 4$$$; Calculated $$$b_4 = \\max(a_4, a_5) = \\max(0, 5) = 5$$$. As a result, she got an array $$$b$$$ = [$$$3, 4, 4, 5$$$] of length $$$4$$$. You only know the array $$$b$$$. Find any matching array $$$a$$$ that Kristina may have originally had.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$ that Kristina originally had. The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n-1$$$ non-negative integer — elements of array $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, and that array $$$b$$$ was built correctly from some array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case on a separate line, print exactly $$$n$$$ non-negative integers — the elements of the array $$$a$$$ that Kristina originally had. If there are several possible answers — output any of them.",
