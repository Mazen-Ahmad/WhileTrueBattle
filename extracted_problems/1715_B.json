  "statement": "Stanley defines the beauty of an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, which contains non-negative integers , as follows: $$$$$$\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \\left \\lfloor \\frac{a_{i}}{k} \\right \\rfloor,$$$$$$ which means that we divide each element by $$$k$$$, round it down, and sum up the resulting values. Stanley told Sam the integer $$$k$$$ and asked him to find an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers, such that the beauty is equal to $$$b$$$ and the sum of elements is equal to $$$s$$$. Help Sam — find any of the arrays satisfying the conditions above.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{5}$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^{9}$$$, $$$0 \\leq b \\leq 10^{9}$$$, $$$0 \\leq s \\leq 10^{18}$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print $$$-1$$$ if such array $$$a$$$ does not exist. Otherwise print $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the answer.",
