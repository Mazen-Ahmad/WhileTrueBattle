  "statement": "You are given an array of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. You can make the following operation: choose an integer $$$x \\geq 2$$$ and replace each number of the array by the remainder when dividing that number by $$$x$$$, that is, for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_i \\bmod x$$$. Determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal by applying the operation zero or more times.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of the array. The sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases is at most $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a line with YES if you can make all elements of the list equal by applying the operation. Otherwise, print NO . You may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as a positive answer).",
