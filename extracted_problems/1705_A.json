  "statement": "Mark is asked to take a group photo of $$$2n$$$ people. The $$$i$$$-th person has height $$$h_i$$$ units. To do so, he ordered these people into two rows, the front row and the back row, each consisting of $$$n$$$ people. However, to ensure that everyone is seen properly, the $$$j$$$-th person of the back row must be at least $$$x$$$ units taller than the $$$j$$$-th person of the front row for each $$$j$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive. Help Mark determine if this is possible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 100$$$, $$$1\\leq x\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of people in each row and the minimum difference Mark wants. The second line of each test case contains $$$2n$$$ positive integers $$$h_1,h_2,\\ldots,h_{2n}$$$ ($$$1\\leq h_i\\leq 10^3$$$) — the height of each person in units. Note that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is not bounded.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line containing \" YES \" if Mark could arrange people satisfying his condition and \" NO \" otherwise. You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES , Yes , yes , yEs will all be recognized as positive answers).",
