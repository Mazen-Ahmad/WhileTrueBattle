  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. We define the equality of the array as the number of indices $$$1 \\le i \\le n - 1$$$ such that $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$. We are allowed to do the following operation: Select two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i \\le n - 1$$$ and $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$. Then, set $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i + 1}$$$ to be equal to $$$x$$$. Find the minimum number of operations needed such that the equality of the array is less than or equal to $$$1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$",
