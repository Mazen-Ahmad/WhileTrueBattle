  "statement": "You are given some text $$$t$$$ and a set of $$$n$$$ strings $$$s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n$$$. In one step, you can choose any occurrence of any string $$$s_i$$$ in the text $$$t$$$ and color the corresponding characters of the text in red. For example, if $$$t=\\texttt{bababa}$$$ and $$$s_1=\\texttt{ba}$$$, $$$s_2=\\texttt{aba}$$$, you can get $$$t=\\color{red}{\\texttt{ba}}\\texttt{baba}$$$, $$$t=\\texttt{b}\\color{red}{\\texttt{aba}}\\texttt{ba}$$$ or $$$t=\\texttt{bab}\\color{red}{\\texttt{aba}}$$$ in one step. You want to color all the letters of the text $$$t$$$ in red. When you color a letter in red again, it stays red. In the example above, three steps are enough: Let's color $$$t[2 \\dots 4]=s_2=\\texttt{aba}$$$ in red, we get $$$t=\\texttt{b}\\color{red}{\\texttt{aba}}\\texttt{ba}$$$; Let's color $$$t[1 \\dots 2]=s_1=\\texttt{ba}$$$ in red, we get $$$t=\\color{red}{\\texttt{baba}}\\texttt{ba}$$$; Let's color $$$t[4 \\dots 6]=s_2=\\texttt{aba}$$$ in red, we get $$$t=\\color{red}{\\texttt{bababa}}$$$. Each string $$$s_i$$$ can be applied any number of times (or not at all). Occurrences for coloring can intersect arbitrarily. Determine the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters $$$t$$$ in red and how to do it. If it is impossible to color all letters of the text $$$t$$$ in red, output -1 .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 100$$$) —the number of test cases in the test. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains the text $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le |t| \\le 100$$$), consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, where $$$|t|$$$ is the length of the text $$$t$$$. The second line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10$$$) — the number of strings in the set. This is followed by $$$n$$$ lines, each containing a string $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s_i| \\le 10$$$) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, where $$$|s_i|$$$ — the length of string $$$s_i$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer on a separate line. If it is impossible to color all the letters of the text in red, print a single line containing the number -1 . Otherwise, on the first line, print the number $$$m$$$ — the minimum number of steps it will take to turn all the letters $$$t$$$ red. Then in the next $$$m$$$ lines print pairs of indices: $$$w_j$$$ and $$$p_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$), which denote that the string with index $$$w_j$$$ was used as a substring to cover the occurrences starting in the text $$$t$$$ from position $$$p_j$$$. The pairs can be output in any order. If there are several answers, output any of them.",
