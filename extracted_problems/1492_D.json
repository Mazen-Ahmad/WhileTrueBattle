  "statement": "You are given three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$k$$$. Find two binary integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$x \\ge y$$$) such that both $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ consist of $$$a$$$ zeroes and $$$b$$$ ones; $$$x - y$$$ (also written in binary form) has exactly $$$k$$$ ones. You are not allowed to use leading zeros for $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ .",
  "inputFormat": "The only line contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a$$$; $$$1 \\leq b$$$; $$$0 \\leq k \\leq a + b \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of zeroes, ones, and the number of ones in the result.",
  "outputFormat": "If it's possible to find two suitable integers, print \" Yes \" followed by $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ in base-2. Otherwise print \" No \". If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.",
