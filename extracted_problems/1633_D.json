  "statement": "You have an array of integers $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Initially, all elements of the array are equal to $$$1$$$. You can perform the following operation: choose two integers $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) and $$$x$$$ ($$$x > 0$$$), and then increase the value of $$$a_i$$$ by $$$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a_i}{x}\\right\\rfloor$$$ (i.e. make $$$a_i = a_i + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{a_i}{x}\\right\\rfloor$$$). After performing all operations, you will receive $$$c_i$$$ coins for all such $$$i$$$ that $$$a_i = b_i$$$. Your task is to determine the maximum number of coins that you can receive by performing no more than $$$k$$$ operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^3; 0 \\le k \\le 10^6$$$) — the size of the array and the maximum number of operations, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^3$$$). The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le 10^6$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^3$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of coins that you can get by performing no more than $$$k$$$ operations.",
