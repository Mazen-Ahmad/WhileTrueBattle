  "statement": "The $$$\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}$$$ of a positive integer is the $$$gcd$$$ of that integer with its sum of digits. Formally, $$$\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(x) = gcd(x, \\text{ sum of digits of } x)$$$ for a positive integer $$$x$$$. $$$gcd(a, b)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ — the largest integer $$$d$$$ such that both integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are divisible by $$$d$$$. For example: $$$\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(762) = gcd(762, 7 + 6 + 2)=gcd(762,15) = 3$$$. Given an integer $$$n$$$, find the smallest integer $$$x \\ge n$$$ such that $$$\\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(x) > 1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\le t \\le 10^4)$$$ — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ lines follow, each containing a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\le n \\le 10^{18})$$$. All test cases in one test are different.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$t$$$ lines, where the $$$i$$$-th line is a single integer containing the answer to the $$$i$$$-th test case.",
