  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Let's call an array integral if for any two, not necessarily different, numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ from this array, $$$x \\ge y$$$, the number $$$\\left \\lfloor \\frac{x}{y} \\right \\rfloor$$$ ($$$x$$$ divided by $$$y$$$ with rounding down) is also in this array. You are guaranteed that all numbers in $$$a$$$ do not exceed $$$c$$$. Your task is to check whether this array is integral.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le c \\le 10^6$$$) — the size of $$$a$$$ and the limit for the numbers in the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le c$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. Let $$$N$$$ be the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases and $$$C$$$ be the sum of $$$c$$$ over all test cases. It is guaranteed that $$$N \\le 10^6$$$ and $$$C \\le 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print Yes if the array is integral and No otherwise.",
