  "statement": "Mike and Joe are playing a game with some stones. Specifically, they have $$$n$$$ piles of stones of sizes $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. These piles are arranged in a circle. The game goes as follows. Players take turns removing some positive number of stones from a pile in clockwise order starting from pile $$$1$$$. Formally, if a player removed stones from pile $$$i$$$ on a turn, the other player removes stones from pile $$$((i\\bmod n) + 1)$$$ on the next turn. If a player cannot remove any stones on their turn (because the pile is empty), they lose. Mike goes first. If Mike and Joe play optimally, who will win?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the number of piles. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the size of the piles.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print the winner of the game, either \"Mike\" or \"Joe\" on its own line (without quotes).",
