  "statement": "Mr. Chanek has an integer represented by a string $$$s$$$. Zero or more digits have been erased and are denoted by the character _ . There are also zero or more digits marked by the character X , meaning they're the same digit. Mr. Chanek wants to count the number of possible integer $$$s$$$, where $$$s$$$ is divisible by $$$25$$$. Of course, $$$s$$$ must not contain any leading zero. He can replace the character _ with any digit. He can also replace the character X with any digit, but it must be the same for every character X . As a note, a leading zero is any 0 digit that comes before the first nonzero digit in a number string in positional notation. For example, 0025 has two leading zeroes. An exception is the integer zero, ( 0 has no leading zero, but 0000 has three leading zeroes).",
  "inputFormat": "One line containing the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq |s| \\leq 8$$$). The string $$$s$$$ consists of the characters 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , _ , and X .",
  "outputFormat": "Output an integer denoting the number of possible integer $$$s$$$.",
