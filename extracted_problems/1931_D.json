  "statement": "Polycarp has two favorite integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ (they can be equal), and he has found an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Polycarp considers a pair of indices $$$\\langle i, j \\rangle$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$) beautiful if: $$$a_i + a_j$$$ is divisible by $$$x$$$; $$$a_i - a_j$$$ is divisible by $$$y$$$. For example, if $$$x=5$$$, $$$y=2$$$, $$$n=6$$$, $$$a=$$$[$$$1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6$$$], then the only beautiful pairs are: $$$\\langle 1, 5 \\rangle$$$: $$$a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10$$$ ($$$10$$$ is divisible by $$$5$$$) and $$$a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8$$$ ($$$-8$$$ is divisible by $$$2$$$); $$$\\langle 4, 6 \\rangle$$$: $$$a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10$$$ ($$$10$$$ is divisible by $$$5$$$) and $$$a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2$$$ ($$$-2$$$ is divisible by $$$2$$$). Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array $$$a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$y$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le x, y \\le 10^9$$$) — the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in the array $$$a$$$.",
