  "statement": "Dimash learned that Mansur wrote something very unpleasant about him to a friend, so he decided to find out his password at all costs and discover what exactly he wrote. Believing in the strength of his password, Mansur stated that his password â€” is a binary string of length $$$n$$$. He is also ready to answer Dimash's questions of the following type: Dimash says a binary string $$$t$$$, and Mansur replies whether it is true that $$$t$$$ is a substring of his password. Help Dimash find out the password in no more than $$$2n$$$ operations; otherwise, Mansur will understand the trick and stop communicating with him.",
