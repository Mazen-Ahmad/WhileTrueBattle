  "statement": "During their training for the ICPC competitions, team \"Jee You See\" stumbled upon a very basic counting problem. After many \"Wrong answer\" verdicts, they finally decided to give up and destroy turn-off the PC. Now they want your help in up-solving the problem. You are given 4 integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$z$$$. Count the number of arrays $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ containing non-negative integers such that: $$$l\\le a_1+a_2+\\ldots+a_n\\le r$$$, and $$$a_1\\oplus a_2 \\oplus \\ldots\\oplus a_n=z$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The only line contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, $$$z$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$, $$$1\\le l\\le r\\le 10^{18}$$$, $$$1\\le z\\le 10^{18}$$$).",
