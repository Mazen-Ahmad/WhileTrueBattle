  "statement": "You are given two arrays of integers — $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, and $$$b_1, \\ldots, b_m$$$ of length $$$m$$$. You can choose any element $$$b_j$$$ from array $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq j \\leq m$$$), and for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ perform $$$a_i = a_i | b_j$$$. You can perform any number of such operations. After all the operations, the value of $$$x = a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus a_n$$$ will be calculated. Find the minimum and maximum values of $$$x$$$ that could be obtained after performing any set of operations. Above, $$$|$$$ is the bitwise OR operation , and $$$\\oplus$$$ is the bitwise XOR operation .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the sizes of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$0 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$2$$$ numbers: the minimum and maximum possible values of $$$x$$$ after performing any set of operations.",
