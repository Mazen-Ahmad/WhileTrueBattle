  "statement": "Alice and Bob play a game. They have a blackboard; initially, there are $$$n$$$ integers written on it, and each integer is equal to $$$1$$$. Alice and Bob take turns; Alice goes first. On their turn, the player has to choose several ( at least two ) equal integers on the board, wipe them and write a new integer which is equal to their sum. For example, if the board currently contains integers $$$\\{1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3\\}$$$, then the following moves are possible: choose two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$2$$$, then the board becomes $$$\\{2, 2, 2, 2, 3\\}$$$; choose two integers equal to $$$2$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$4$$$, then the board becomes $$$\\{1, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$$; choose three integers equal to $$$2$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$6$$$, then the board becomes $$$\\{1, 1, 3, 6\\}$$$. If a player cannot make a move (all integers on the board are different), that player wins the game . Determine who wins if both players play optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 99$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of integers equal to $$$1$$$ on the board.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print Alice if Alice wins when both players play optimally. Otherwise, print Bob .",
