  "statement": "Tokitsukaze has a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Let's call a segment $$$[l,r]$$$ beautiful if there exist $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ satisfying $$$p_i \\cdot p_j = \\max\\{p_l, p_{l+1}, \\ldots, p_r \\}$$$, where $$$l \\leq i < j \\leq r$$$. Now Tokitsukaze has $$$q$$$ queries, in the $$$i$$$-th query she wants to know how many beautiful subsegments $$$[x,y]$$$ there are in the segment $$$[l_i,r_i]$$$ (i. e. $$$l_i \\leq x \\leq y \\leq r_i$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1\\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^6$$$) — the length of permutation $$$p$$$ and the number of queries. The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$) — the segment $$$[l_i,r_i]$$$ of this query.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print one integer — the numbers of beautiful subsegments in the segment $$$[l_i,r_i]$$$.",
