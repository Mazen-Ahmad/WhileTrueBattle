  "statement": "Highway 201 is the most busy street in Rockport. Traffic cars cause a lot of hindrances to races, especially when there are a lot of them. The track which passes through this highway can be divided into $$$n$$$ sub-tracks. You are given an array $$$a$$$ where $$$a_i$$$ represents the number of traffic cars in the $$$i$$$-th sub-track. You define the inconvenience of the track as $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\sum\\limits_{j=i+1}^{n} \\lvert a_i-a_j\\rvert$$$, where $$$|x|$$$ is the absolute value of $$$x$$$. You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: choose a traffic car and move it from its current sub-track to any other sub-track. Find the minimum inconvenience you can achieve.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 10\\,000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\\leq a_i\\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer: the minimum inconvenience you can achieve by applying the given operation any (possibly zero) number of times.",
