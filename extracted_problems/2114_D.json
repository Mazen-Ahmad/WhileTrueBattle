  "statement": "The game field is a matrix of size $$$10^9 \\times 10^9$$$, with a cell at the intersection of the $$$a$$$-th row and the $$$b$$$-th column denoted as ($$$a, b$$$). There are $$$n$$$ monsters on the game field, with the $$$i$$$-th monster located in the cell ($$$x_i, y_i$$$), while the other cells are empty. No more than one monster can occupy a single cell. You can move one monster to any cell on the field that is not occupied by another monster at most once . After that, you must select one rectangle on the field; all monsters within the selected rectangle will be destroyed. You must pay $$$1$$$ coin for each cell in the selected rectangle. Your task is to find the minimum number of coins required to destroy all the monsters.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of monsters on the field. The following $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the cell with the $$$i$$$-th monster. All pairs ($$$x_i, y_i$$$) are distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum cost to destroy all $$$n$$$ monsters.",
