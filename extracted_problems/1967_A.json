  "statement": "You have some cards. An integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ is written on each card: specifically, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, you have $$$a_i$$$ cards which have the number $$$i$$$ written on them. There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have $$$k$$$ coins, so you can buy $$$k$$$ new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$. After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length $$$n$$$ which are a permutation of $$$[1, 2, \\ldots, n]$$$. What's the maximum score you can get?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t\\ (1\\le t\\le 100)$$$. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0\\le k \\le 10^{12}$$$) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{12}$$$) — the number of cards of type $$$i$$$ you have at the beginning. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum score you can get.",
