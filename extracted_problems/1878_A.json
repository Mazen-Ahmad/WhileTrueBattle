  "statement": "We define an integer to be the most common on a subsegment, if its number of occurrences on that subsegment is larger than the number of occurrences of any other integer in that subsegment. A subsegment of an array is a consecutive segment of elements in the array $$$a$$$. Given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$, and an integer $$$k$$$, determine if there exists a non-empty subsegment of $$$a$$$ where $$$k$$$ is the most common element .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 100$$$) — the number of elements in array and the element which must be the most common . The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_3$$$, $$$\\dots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$) — elements of the array.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output \" YES \" if there exists a subsegment in which $$$k$$$ is the most common element, and \" NO \" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \", and \" YES \" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
