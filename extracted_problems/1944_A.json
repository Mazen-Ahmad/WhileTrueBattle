  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ islands, numbered $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of $$$\\frac{n (n - 1)}{2}$$$ bridges. Everule lives on island $$$1$$$ and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges. Dominater has the power to destroy at most $$$k$$$ bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges. Find the minimum number of islands (including island $$$1$$$) that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$, $$$0 \\le k \\le \\frac{n \\cdot (n - 1)}{2}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.",
