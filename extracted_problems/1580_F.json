  "statement": "XYMXYM and CQXYM will prepare $$$n$$$ problems for Codeforces. The difficulty of the problem $$$i$$$ will be an integer $$$a_i$$$, where $$$a_i \\geq 0$$$. The difficulty of the problems must satisfy $$$a_i+a_{i+1}<m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i < n$$$), and $$$a_1+a_n<m$$$, where $$$m$$$ is a fixed integer. XYMXYM wants to know how many plans of the difficulty of the problems there are modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Two plans of difficulty $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are different only if there is an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) satisfying $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "A single line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 50\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer â€” the number of different plans.",
