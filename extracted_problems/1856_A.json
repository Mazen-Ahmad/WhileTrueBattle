  "statement": "Alphen has an array of positive integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Alphen can perform the following operation: For all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\max(0, a_i - 1)$$$. Alphen will perform the above operation until $$$a$$$ is sorted, that is $$$a$$$ satisfies $$$a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq a_n$$$. How many operations will Alphen perform? Under the constraints of the problem, it can be proven that Alphen will perform a finite number of operations.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10 ^ 9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of operations that Alphen will perform.",
