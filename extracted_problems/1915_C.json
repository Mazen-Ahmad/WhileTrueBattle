  "statement": "Calin has $$$n$$$ buckets, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains $$$a_i$$$ wooden squares of side length $$$1$$$. Can Calin build a square using all the given squares?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of buckets. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of squares in each bucket. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" YES \" if Calin can build a square using all of the given $$$1 \\times 1$$$ squares, and \" NO \" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \" and \" YES \" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
