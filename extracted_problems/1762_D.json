  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. There is a secret permutation $$$p$$$ of $$$[0,1,2,\\ldots,n-1]$$$. Your task is to find $$$2$$$ indices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$$$, possibly $$$x=y$$$) such that $$$p_x=0$$$ or $$$p_y=0$$$. In order to find it, you are allowed to ask at most $$$2n$$$ queries. In one query, you give two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$, $$$i \\neq j$$$) and receive the value of $$$\\gcd(p_i,p_j)^\\dagger$$$. Note that the permutation $$$p$$$ is fixed before any queries are made and does not depend on the queries. $$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Note that $$$\\gcd(x,0)=\\gcd(0,x)=x$$$ for all positive integers $$$x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$). After reading the integer $$$n$$$ for each test case, you should begin the interaction. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^4$$$.",
