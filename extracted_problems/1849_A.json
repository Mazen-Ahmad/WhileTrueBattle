  "statement": "Monocarp always starts his morning with a good ol' sandwich. Sandwiches Monocarp makes always consist of bread, cheese and/or ham. A sandwich always follows the formula: a piece of bread a slice of cheese or ham a piece of bread $$$\\dots$$$ a slice of cheese or ham a piece of bread So it always has bread on top and at the bottom, and it alternates between bread and filling, where filling is a slice of either cheese or ham. Each piece of bread and each slice of cheese or ham is called a layer. Today Monocarp woke up and discovered that he has $$$b$$$ pieces of bread, $$$c$$$ slices of cheese and $$$h$$$ slices of ham. What is the maximum number of layers his morning sandwich can have?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of three integers $$$b, c$$$ and $$$h$$$ ($$$2 \\le b \\le 100$$$; $$$1 \\le c, h \\le 100$$$) — the number of pieces of bread, slices of cheese and slices of ham, respectively.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum number of layers Monocarp's morning sandwich can have.",
