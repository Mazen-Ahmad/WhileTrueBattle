  "statement": "There is an empty matrix $$$M$$$ of size $$$n\\times m$$$. Zhongkao examination is over, and Daniel would like to do some puzzle games. He is going to fill in the matrix $$$M$$$ using permutations of length $$$m$$$. That is, each row of $$$M$$$ must be a permutation of length $$$m^\\dagger$$$. Define the value of the $$$i$$$-th column in $$$M$$$ as $$$v_i=\\operatorname{MEX}(M_{1,i},M_{2,i},\\ldots,M_{n,i})^\\ddagger$$$. Since Daniel likes diversity, the beauty of $$$M$$$ is $$$s=\\operatorname{MEX}(v_1,v_2,\\cdots,v_m)$$$. You have to help Daniel fill in the matrix $$$M$$$ and maximize its beauty. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation of length $$$m$$$ is an array consisting of $$$m$$$ distinct integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$m-1$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[1,2,0,4,3]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[0,1,1]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$1$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[0,1,3]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$m-1=2$$$ but there is $$$3$$$ in the array). $$$^\\ddagger$$$ The $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For example, $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(2,2,1)=0$$$ because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array, and $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(0,3,1,2)=4$$$ because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ appear in the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\le n,m\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the matrix. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n\\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, in the first line output a single integer — the maximum beauty of $$$M$$$. Then output the matrix $$$M$$$ of size $$$n\\times m$$$ — the matrix you find. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.",
