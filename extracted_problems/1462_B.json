  "statement": "Polycarp has a string $$$s[1 \\dots n]$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of decimal digits. Polycarp performs the following operation with the string $$$s$$$ no more than once (i.e. he can perform operation $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ time): Polycarp selects two numbers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq n$$$) and removes characters from the $$$s$$$ string at the positions $$$i, i+1, i+2, \\ldots, j$$$ (i.e. removes substring $$$s[i \\dots j]$$$). More formally, Polycarp turns the string $$$s$$$ into the string $$$s_1 s_2 \\ldots s_{i-1} s_{j+1} s_{j+2} \\ldots s_{n}$$$. For example, the string $$$s = $$$\" 20192020 \" Polycarp can turn into strings: \" 2020 \" (in this case $$$(i, j)=(3, 6)$$$ or $$$(i, j)=(1, 4)$$$); \" 2019220 \" (in this case $$$(i, j)=(6, 6)$$$); \" 020 \" (in this case $$$(i, j)=(1, 5)$$$); other operations are also possible, only a few of them are listed above. Polycarp likes the string \" 2020 \" very much, so he is wondering if it is possible to turn the string $$$s$$$ into a string \" 2020 \" in no more than one operation? Note that you can perform zero operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000 $$$) — number of test cases in the test. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\leq n \\leq 200$$$) — length of the string $$$s$$$. The next line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of decimal digits. It is allowed that the string $$$s$$$ starts with digit 0 .",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output on a separate line: \" YES \" if Polycarp can turn the string $$$s$$$ into a string \" 2020 \" in no more than one operation (i.e. he can perform $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ operation); \" NO \" otherwise. You may print every letter of \" YES \" and \" NO \" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).",
