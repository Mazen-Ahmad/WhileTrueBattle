  "statement": "There is a matrix consisting of $$$2$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$ from top to bottom; the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Let's denote the cell on the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column as $$$(i,j)$$$. Each cell contains an integer; initially, the integer in the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ is $$$a_{i,j}$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose two columns and swap them (i. e. choose two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$1 \\le x < y \\le n$$$, then swap $$$a_{1,x}$$$ with $$$a_{1,y}$$$, and then swap $$$a_{2,x}$$$ with $$$a_{2,y}$$$). After performing the operations, you have to choose a path from the cell $$$(1,1)$$$ to the cell $$$(2,n)$$$. For every cell $$$(i,j)$$$ in the path except for the last, the next cell should be either $$$(i+1,j)$$$ or $$$(i,j+1)$$$. Obviously, the path cannot go outside the matrix. The cost of the path is the sum of all integers in all $$$(n+1)$$$ cells belonging to the path. You have to perform the operations and choose a path so that its cost is maximum possible.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5000$$$) — the number of columns in the matrix; the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1,1}, a_{1,2}, \\ldots, a_{1,n}$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\le a_{i,j} \\le 10^5$$$) — the first row of the matrix; the third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{2,1}, a_{2,2}, \\ldots, a_{2,n}$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\le a_{i,j} \\le 10^5$$$) — the second row of the matrix. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the maximum cost of a path you can obtain.",
