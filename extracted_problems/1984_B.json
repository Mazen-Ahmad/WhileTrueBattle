  "statement": "A digit is large if it is between $$$5$$$ and $$$9$$$, inclusive. A positive integer is large if all of its digits are large. You are given an integer $$$x$$$. Can it be the sum of two large positive integers with the same number of digits ?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$10 \\leq x \\leq 10^{18}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if $$$x$$$ satisfies the condition, and $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise. You can output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$ in any case (for example, strings $$$\\texttt{yES}$$$, $$$\\texttt{yes}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$ will be recognized as a positive response).",
