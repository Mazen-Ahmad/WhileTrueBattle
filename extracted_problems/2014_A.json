  "statement": "There is a little bit of the outlaw in everyone, and a little bit of the hero too. The heroic outlaw Robin Hood is famous for taking from the rich and giving to the poor. Robin encounters $$$n$$$ people starting from the $$$1$$$-st and ending with the $$$n$$$-th. The $$$i$$$-th person has $$$a_i$$$ gold. If $$$a_i \\ge k$$$, Robin will take all $$$a_i$$$ gold, and if $$$a_i=0$$$, Robin will give $$$1$$$ gold if he has any. Robin starts with $$$0$$$ gold. Find out how many people Robin gives gold to.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50, 1 \\le k \\le 100$$$) — the number of people and the threshold at which Robin Hood takes the gold. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$) — the gold of each person.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer, the number of people that will get gold from Robin Hood.",
