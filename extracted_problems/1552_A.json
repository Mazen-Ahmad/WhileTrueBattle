  "statement": "A string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, is given. You must choose some number $$$k$$$ between $$$0$$$ and $$$n$$$. Then, you select $$$k$$$ characters of $$$s$$$ and permute them however you want. In this process, the positions of the other $$$n-k$$$ characters remain unchanged. You have to perform this operation exactly once. For example, if $$$s=\\texttt{\"andrea\"}$$$, you can choose the $$$k=4$$$ characters $$$\\texttt{\"a_d_ea\"}$$$ and permute them into $$$\\texttt{\"d_e_aa\"}$$$ so that after the operation the string becomes $$$\\texttt{\"dneraa\"}$$$. Determine the minimum $$$k$$$ so that it is possible to sort $$$s$$$ alphabetically (that is, after the operation its characters appear in alphabetical order).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 40$$$) — the length of the string. The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$s$$$ contains only lowercase letters of the English alphabet.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum $$$k$$$ that allows you to obtain a string sorted alphabetically, through the operation described above.",
