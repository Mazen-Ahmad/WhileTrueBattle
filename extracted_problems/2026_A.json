  "statement": "You are given a coordinate plane and three integers $$$X$$$, $$$Y$$$, and $$$K$$$. Find two line segments $$$AB$$$ and $$$CD$$$ such that the coordinates of points $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$, and $$$D$$$ are integers; $$$0 \\le A_x, B_x, C_x, D_x \\le X$$$ and $$$0 \\le A_y, B_y, C_y, D_y \\le Y$$$; the length of segment $$$AB$$$ is at least $$$K$$$; the length of segment $$$CD$$$ is at least $$$K$$$; segments $$$AB$$$ and $$$CD$$$ are perpendicular : if you draw lines that contain $$$AB$$$ and $$$CD$$$, they will cross at a right angle. Note that it's not necessary for segments to intersect. Segments are perpendicular as long as the lines they induce are perpendicular.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. Next, $$$t$$$ cases follow. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$X$$$, $$$Y$$$, and $$$K$$$ ($$$1 \\le X, Y \\le 1000$$$; $$$1 \\le K \\le 1414$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the values of $$$X$$$, $$$Y$$$, and $$$K$$$ are chosen in such a way that the answer exists.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print two lines. The first line should contain $$$4$$$ integers $$$A_x$$$, $$$A_y$$$, $$$B_x$$$, and $$$B_y$$$ — the coordinates of the first segment. The second line should also contain $$$4$$$ integers $$$C_x$$$, $$$C_y$$$, $$$D_x$$$, and $$$D_y$$$ — the coordinates of the second segment. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
