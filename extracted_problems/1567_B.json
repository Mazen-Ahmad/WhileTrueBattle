  "statement": "Alice gave Bob two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$a > 0$$$ and $$$b \\ge 0$$$). Being a curious boy, Bob wrote down an array of non-negative integers with $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ value of all elements equal to $$$a$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ value of all elements equal to $$$b$$$. What is the shortest possible length of the array Bob wrote? Recall that the $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ ( Minimum EXcluded ) of an array is the minimum non-negative integer that does not belong to the array and the $$$\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ of an array is the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the array.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$0 \\leq b \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ of the array, respectively.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one (positive) integer — the length of the shortest array with $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ $$$a$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{XOR}$$$ $$$b$$$. We can show that such an array always exists.",
