  "statement": "Let's define the cost of a string $$$s$$$ as the number of index pairs $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < j < |s|$$$) such that $$$s_i = s_j$$$ and $$$s_{i+1} = s_{j+1}$$$. You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Among all strings with length $$$n$$$ that contain only the first $$$k$$$ characters of the Latin alphabet, find a string with minimum possible cost . If there are multiple such strings with minimum cost — find any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5; 1 \\le k \\le 26$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print the string $$$s$$$ such that it consists of $$$n$$$ characters, each its character is one of the $$$k$$$ first Latin letters, and it has the minimum possible cost among all these strings. If there are multiple such strings — print any of them.",
