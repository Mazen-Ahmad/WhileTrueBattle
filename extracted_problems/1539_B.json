  "statement": "Petya once wrote a sad love song and shared it to Vasya. The song is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Vasya made up $$$q$$$ questions about this song. Each question is about a subsegment of the song starting from the $$$l$$$-th letter to the $$$r$$$-th letter. Vasya considers a substring made up from characters on this segment and repeats each letter in the subsegment $$$k$$$ times, where $$$k$$$ is the index of the corresponding letter in the alphabet. For example, if the question is about the substring \" abbcb \", then Vasya repeats letter ' a ' once, each of the letters ' b ' twice, letter ' c \" three times, so that the resulting string is \" abbbbcccbb \", its length is $$$10$$$. Vasya is interested about the length of the resulting string. Help Petya find the length of each string obtained by Vasya.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 100\\,000$$$, $$$1\\leq q \\leq 100\\,000$$$) — the length of the song and the number of questions. The second line contains one string $$$s$$$ — the song, consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase letters of English letters. Vasya's questions are contained in the next $$$q$$$ lines. Each line contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$) — the bounds of the question.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$q$$$ lines: for each question print the length of the string obtained by Vasya.",
