  "statement": "378QAQ has a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Define the core of a string as the substring$$$^\\dagger$$$ with maximum lexicographic$$$^\\ddagger$$$ order. For example, the core of \"$$$\\mathtt{bazoka}$$$\" is \"$$$\\mathtt{zoka}$$$\", and the core of \"$$$\\mathtt{aaa}$$$\" is \"$$$\\mathtt{aaa}$$$\". 378QAQ wants to rearrange the string $$$s$$$ so that the core is lexicographically minimum. Find the lexicographically minimum possible core over all rearrangements of $$$s$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A substring of string $$$s$$$ is a continuous segment of letters from $$$s$$$. For example, \"$$$\\mathtt{defor}$$$\", \"$$$\\mathtt{code}$$$\" and \"$$$\\mathtt{o}$$$\" are all substrings of \"$$$\\mathtt{codeforces}$$$\" while \"$$$\\mathtt{codes}$$$\" and \"$$$\\mathtt{aaa}$$$\" are not. $$$^\\ddagger$$$ A string $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$q$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$p$$$ is a prefix of $$$q$$$, but $$$p \\ne q$$$; or in the first position where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ differ, the string $$$p$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$q$$$ (when compared by their ASCII code). For example, \"$$$\\mathtt{code}$$$\" and \"$$$\\mathtt{coda}$$$\" are both lexicographically smaller than \"$$$\\mathtt{codeforces}$$$\" while \"$$$\\mathtt{codeforceston}$$$\" and \"$$$\\mathtt{z}$$$\" are not.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 10^6$$$) â€” the length of string $$$s$$$. The next line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The string $$$s$$$ consists of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the lexicographically minimum possible core over all rearrangements of $$$s$$$.",
