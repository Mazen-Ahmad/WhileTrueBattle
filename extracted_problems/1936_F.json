  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ circles on the plane. The $$$i$$$-th of these circles is given by a tuple of integers $$$(x_i, y_i, r_i)$$$, where $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ are the coordinates of its center, and $$$r_i$$$ is the radius of the circle. Please find a circle $$$C$$$ which meets the following conditions: $$$C$$$ is contained inside all $$$n$$$ circles given in the input. Among all circles $$$C$$$ that meet the first condition, the radius of the circle is maximum. Let the largest suitable circle have the radius of $$$a$$$. Your output $$$C$$$, described as $$$(x,y,r)$$$, will be accepted if it meets the following conditions: For each $$$i$$$, $$$\\sqrt{(x_i-x)^2+(y_i-y)^2}+ r \\le r_i+\\max(a,1)\\cdot 10^{-7}$$$. The absolute or relative error of $$$r$$$ does not exceed $$$10^{-7}$$$. Formally, your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\\frac{\\left|r - a\\right|}{\\max(1, a)} \\le 10^{-7}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of circles. The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\le x_i,y_i \\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le r_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed that there is a circle with a radius of at least $$$10^{-6}$$$ which is contained inside all $$$n$$$ circles.",
  "outputFormat": "Output three real values, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$r$$$ — the coordinates of the center and the radius of the circle.",
