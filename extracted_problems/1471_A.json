  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, and an integer $$$x$$$. You can perform the following operation as many times as you would like (possibly zero): replace two adjacent elements of the array by their sum. For example, if the initial array was $$$[3, 6, 9]$$$, in a single operation one can replace the last two elements by their sum, yielding an array $$$[3, 15]$$$, or replace the first two elements to get an array $$$[9, 9]$$$. Note that the size of the array decreases after each operation. The beauty of an array $$$b=[b_1, \\ldots, b_k]$$$ is defined as $$$\\sum_{i=1}^k \\left\\lceil \\frac{b_i}{x} \\right\\rceil$$$, which means that we divide each element by $$$x$$$, round it up to the nearest integer, and sum up the resulting values. For example, if $$$x = 3$$$, and the array is $$$[4, 11, 6]$$$, the beauty of the array is equal to $$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{4}{3} \\right\\rceil + \\left\\lceil \\frac{11}{3} \\right\\rceil + \\left\\lceil \\frac{6}{3} \\right\\rceil = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8$$$. Please determine the minimum and the maximum beauty you can get by performing some operations on the original array.",
  "inputFormat": "The first input line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ — the number of test cases ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$$$). The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$), the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output two integers — the minimal and the maximal possible beauty.",
