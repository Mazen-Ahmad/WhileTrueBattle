  "statement": "You are planning a hike in the Peneda-Gerês National Park in the north of Portugal. The park takes its name from two of its highest peaks: Peneda (1340 m) and Gerês (1545 m). For this problem, the park is modelled as an infinite plane, where each position $$$(x, y)$$$, with $$$x, y$$$ being integers, has a specific altitude. The altitudes are defined by an $$$n \\times n$$$ matrix $$$h$$$, which repeats periodically across the plane. Specifically, for any integers $$$a, b$$$ and $$$0 \\leq x, y < n$$$, the altitude at $$$(x + an, y + bn)$$$ is $$$h[x][y]$$$. When you are at position $$$(x, y)$$$, you can move to any of the four adjacent positions: $$$(x, y+1)$$$, $$$(x+1, y)$$$, $$$(x, y-1)$$$, or $$$(x-1, y)$$$. The time required to move between two adjacent positions is $$$1 + \\lvert \\text{alt}_1 - \\text{alt}_2 \\rvert$$$, where $$$\\text{alt}_1$$$ and $$$\\text{alt}_2$$$ are the altitudes of the current and destination positions, respectively. Initially, your position is $$$(0, 0)$$$. Compute the number of distinct positions you can reach within $$$10^{20}$$$ seconds. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative error is less than $$$10^{-6}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 20$$$)—the size of the matrix describing the altitudes. The following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ integers each. The $$$(j+1)$$$-th number on the $$$(i+1)$$$-th of these lines is $$$h[i][j]$$$ ($$$0\\le h[i][j] \\le 1545$$$)—the altitude of the position $$$(i, j)$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print the number of distinct positions you can reach within $$$10^{20}$$$ seconds. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative error is less than $$$10^{-6}$$$.",
