  "statement": "Monocarp is playing yet another computer game. And yet again, his character is killing some monsters. There are $$$n$$$ monsters, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and the $$$i$$$-th of them has $$$a_i$$$ health points initially. Monocarp's character has an ability that deals $$$k$$$ damage to the monster with the highest current health . If there are several of them, the one with the smaller index is chosen . If a monster's health becomes less than or equal to $$$0$$$ after Monocarp uses his ability, then it dies. Monocarp uses his ability until all monsters die. Your task is to determine the order in which monsters will die.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of monsters and the damage which Monocarp's ability deals. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the initial health points of monsters. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers — the indices of monsters in the order they die.",
