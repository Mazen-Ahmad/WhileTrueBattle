  "statement": "The position of the leftmost maximum on the segment $$$[l; r]$$$ of array $$$x = [x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n]$$$ is the smallest integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$l \\le i \\le r$$$ and $$$x_i = \\max(x_l, x_{l+1}, \\ldots, x_r)$$$. You are given an array $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Find the number of integer arrays $$$b = [b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n]$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that satisfy the following conditions: $$$1 \\le b_i \\le m$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$; for all pairs of integers $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, the position of the leftmost maximum on the segment $$$[l; r]$$$ of the array $$$b$$$ is equal to the position of the leftmost maximum on the segment $$$[l; r]$$$ of the array $$$a$$$. Since the answer might be very large, print its remainder modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n,m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n \\cdot m \\le 10^6$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le m$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print one integer — the number of arrays $$$b$$$ that satisfy the conditions from the statement, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
