  "statement": "There are 3 heroes and 3 villains, so 6 people in total. Given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Find the smallest integer whose decimal representation has length $$$n$$$ and consists only of $$$3$$$s and $$$6$$$s such that it is divisible by both $$$33$$$ and $$$66$$$. If no such integer exists, print $$$-1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 500$$$) — the length of the decimal representation.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the smallest required integer if such an integer exists and $$$-1$$$ otherwise.",
