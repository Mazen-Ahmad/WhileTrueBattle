  "statement": "It is a municipality election year. Even though the leader of the country has not changed for two decades, the elections are always transparent and fair. There are $$$n$$$ political candidates, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, contesting the right to govern. The elections happen using a variation of the Ranked Voting System . In their ballot, each voter will rank all $$$n$$$ candidates from most preferable to least preferable. That is, each vote is a permutation of $$$\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$$$, where the first element of the permutation corresponds to the most preferable candidate. We say that candidate $$$a$$$ defeats candidate $$$b$$$ if in more than half of the votes candidate $$$a$$$ is more preferable than candidate $$$b$$$. As the election is fair and transparent, the state television has already decreed a list of $$$m$$$ facts—the $$$i$$$-th fact being \"candidate $$$a_i$$$ has defeated candidate $$$b_i$$$\"—all before the actual election! You are in charge of the election commission and tallying up the votes. You need to present a list of votes that produces the outcome advertised on television, or to determine that it is not possible. However, you are strongly encouraged to find a solution, or you might upset higher-ups.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$) — the number of parties and the number of pairs with known election outcomes. The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n$$$, $$$a_i \\ne b_i$$$) — candidate $$$a_i$$$ defeats candidate $$$b_i$$$. Each unordered pair $$$\\{a_i, b_i\\}$$$ is given at most once.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if there is a list of votes matching the facts advertised on television. Otherwise, print $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$. If there is a valid list of votes, print one such list in the following lines. Print the number $$$k$$$ of votes cast ($$$1 \\le k \\le 50\\,000$$$). It can be shown that if there is a valid list of votes, there is one with at most $$$50\\,000$$$ votes. Then print $$$k$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines consists of a permutation of $$$\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$$$ describing the $$$i$$$-th vote. The first number in the permutation is the most preferable candidate and the last one is the least preferable candidate. For $$$1\\le i\\le m$$$, $$$a_i$$$ shall appear earlier than $$$b_i$$$ in more than $$$k{/}2$$$ of the $$$k$$$ permutations. For pairs of candidates $$$\\{a, b\\}$$$ not appearing in the election requirements list, the outcome can be arbitrary, including neither of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ defeating the other.",
