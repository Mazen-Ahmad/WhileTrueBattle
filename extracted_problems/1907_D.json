  "statement": "Polycarp is designing a level for a game. The level consists of $$$n$$$ segments on the number line, where the $$$i$$$-th segment starts at the point with coordinate $$$l_i$$$ and ends at the point with coordinate $$$r_i$$$. The player starts the level at the point with coordinate $$$0$$$. In one move, they can move to any point that is within a distance of no more than $$$k$$$. After their $$$i$$$-th move, the player must land within the $$$i$$$-th segment, that is, at a coordinate $$$x$$$ such that $$$l_i \\le x \\le r_i$$$. This means: After the first move, they must be inside the first segment (from $$$l_1$$$ to $$$r_1$$$); After the second move, they must be inside the second segment (from $$$l_2$$$ to $$$r_2$$$); ... After the $$$n$$$-th move, they must be inside the $$$n$$$-th segment (from $$$l_n$$$ to $$$r_n$$$). The level is considered completed if the player reaches the $$$n$$$-th segment, following the rules described above. After some thought, Polycarp realized that it is impossible to complete the level with some values of $$$k$$$. Polycarp does not want the level to be too easy, so he asks you to determine the minimum integer $$$k$$$ with which it is possible to complete the level.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)—the number of test cases. Descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)—the number of segments in the level. The following $$$n$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 10^9$$$)—the boundaries of the $$$i$$$-th segment. Segments may intersect. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer—the minimum value of $$$k$$$ with which it is possible to complete the level.",
