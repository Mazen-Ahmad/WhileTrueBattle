  "statement": "You are given an unsorted permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$. To sort the permutation, you choose a constant $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 1$$$) and do some operations on the permutation. In one operation, you can choose two integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j < i \\le n$$$) such that $$$i - j = k$$$, then swap $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$. What is the maximum value of $$$k$$$ that you can choose to sort the given permutation? A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2, 3, 1, 5, 4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1, 2, 2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1, 3, 4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n = 3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). An unsorted permutation $$$p$$$ is a permutation such that there is at least one position $$$i$$$ that satisfies $$$p_i \\ne i$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^{5}$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$. It is guaranteed that the given numbers form a permutation of length $$$n$$$ and the given permutation is unsorted . It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum value of $$$k$$$ that you can choose to sort the given permutation. We can show that an answer always exists.",
