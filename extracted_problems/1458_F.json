  "statement": "You are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered $$$1, \\ldots, n$$$. A tree is a connected simple graph without cycles. Let $$$\\mathrm{dist}(u, v)$$$ be the number of edges in the unique simple path connecting vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. Let $$$\\mathrm{diam}(l, r) = \\max \\mathrm{dist}(u, v)$$$ over all pairs $$$u, v$$$ such that $$$l \\leq u, v \\leq r$$$. Compute $$$\\sum_{1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n} \\mathrm{diam}(l, r)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree. The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines describe the tree edges. Each of these lines contains two integers $$$u, v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$$$) — endpoint indices of the respective tree edge. It is guaranteed that the edge list indeed describes a tree.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer — $$$\\sum_{1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n} \\mathrm{diam}(l, r)$$$.",
