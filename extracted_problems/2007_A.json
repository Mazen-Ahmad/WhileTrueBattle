  "statement": "Dora has a set $$$s$$$ containing integers. In the beginning, she will put all integers in $$$[l, r]$$$ into the set $$$s$$$. That is, an integer $$$x$$$ is initially contained in the set if and only if $$$l \\leq x \\leq r$$$. Then she allows you to perform the following operations: Select three distinct integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ from the set $$$s$$$, such that $$$\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, c) = \\gcd(a, c) = 1^\\dagger$$$. Then, remove these three integers from the set $$$s$$$. What is the maximum number of operations you can perform? $$$^\\dagger$$$Recall that $$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ means the greatest common divisor of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq 1000$$$) — the range of integers in the initial set.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of operations you can perform.",
