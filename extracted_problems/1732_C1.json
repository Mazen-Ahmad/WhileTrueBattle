  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$q = 1$$$. You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. The cost of a subsegment of the array $$$[l, r]$$$, $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$, is the value $$$f(l, r) = \\operatorname{sum}(l, r) - \\operatorname{xor}(l, r)$$$, where $$$\\operatorname{sum}(l, r) = a_l + a_{l+1} + \\ldots + a_r$$$, and $$$\\operatorname{xor}(l, r) = a_l \\oplus a_{l+1} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus a_r$$$ ($$$\\oplus$$$ stands for bitwise XOR ). You will have $$$q = 1$$$ query. Each query is given by a pair of numbers $$$L_i$$$, $$$R_i$$$, where $$$1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq n$$$. You need to find the subsegment $$$[l, r]$$$, $$$L_i \\leq l \\leq r \\leq R_i$$$, with maximum value $$$f(l, r)$$$. If there are several answers, then among them you need to find a subsegment with the minimum length, that is, the minimum value of $$$r - l + 1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$q = 1$$$) — the length of the array and the number of queries. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — array elements. $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines of each test case contains two integers $$$L_i$$$ and $$$R_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq n$$$) — the boundaries in which we need to find the segment. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$L_1 = 1$$$ and $$$R_1 = n$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print $$$q$$$ pairs of numbers $$$L_i \\leq l \\leq r \\leq R_i$$$ such that the value $$$f(l, r)$$$ is maximum and among such the length $$$r - l + 1$$$ is minimum. If there are several correct answers, print any of them.",
