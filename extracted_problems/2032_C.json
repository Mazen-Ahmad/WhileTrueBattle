  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. You can perform the following operation any number (possibly $$$0$$$) of times: Choose two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, where $$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, and assign $$$a_i := a_j$$$. Find the minimum number of operations required to make the array $$$a$$$ satisfy the condition: For every pairwise distinct triplet of indices $$$(x, y, z)$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y, z \\le n$$$, $$$x \\ne y$$$, $$$y \\ne z$$$, $$$x \\ne z$$$), there exists a non-degenerate triangle with side lengths $$$a_x$$$, $$$a_y$$$ and $$$a_z$$$, i.e. $$$a_x + a_y > a_z$$$, $$$a_y + a_z > a_x$$$ and $$$a_z + a_x > a_y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
