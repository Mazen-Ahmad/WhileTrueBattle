  "statement": "You are given five integers $$$n$$$, $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$y$$$. Find the number of bitonic permutations $$$B$$$, of the numbers $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, such that $$$B_i=x$$$, and $$$B_j=y$$$. Since the answer can be large, compute it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. A bitonic permutation is a permutation of numbers, such that the elements of the permutation first increase till a certain index $$$k$$$, $$$2 \\le k \\le n-1$$$, and then decrease till the end. Refer to notes for further clarification.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains five integers, $$$n$$$, $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$y$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 100$$$ and $$$1 \\le i,j,x,y \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$x \\ne y$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing the number of bitonic permutations satisfying the above conditions modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
