  "statement": "An ant moves on the real line with constant speed of $$$1$$$ unit per second. It starts at $$$0$$$ and always moves to the right (so its position increases by $$$1$$$ each second). There are $$$n$$$ portals, the $$$i$$$-th of which is located at position $$$x_i$$$ and teleports to position $$$y_i < x_i$$$. Each portal can be either active or inactive . The initial state of the $$$i$$$-th portal is determined by $$$s_i$$$: if $$$s_i=0$$$ then the $$$i$$$-th portal is initially inactive, if $$$s_i=1$$$ then the $$$i$$$-th portal is initially active. When the ant travels through a portal (i.e., when its position coincides with the position of a portal): if the portal is inactive, it becomes active (in this case the path of the ant is not affected); if the portal is active, it becomes inactive and the ant is instantly teleported to the position $$$y_i$$$, where it keeps on moving as normal. How long (from the instant it starts moving) does it take for the ant to reach the position $$$x_n + 1$$$? It can be shown that this happens in a finite amount of time. Since the answer may be very large, compute it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of portals. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1\\le y_i < x_i\\le 10^9$$$, $$$s_i\\in\\{0,1\\}$$$) — the position of the $$$i$$$-th portal, the position where the ant is teleported when it travels through the $$$i$$$-th portal (if it is active), and the initial state of the $$$i$$$-th portal. The positions of the portals are strictly increasing, that is $$$x_1<x_2<\\cdots<x_n$$$. It is guaranteed that the $$$2n$$$ integers $$$x_1, \\, x_2, \\, \\dots, \\, x_n, \\, y_1, \\, y_2, \\, \\dots, \\, y_n$$$ are all distinct.",
  "outputFormat": "Output the amount of time elapsed, in seconds, from the instant the ant starts moving to the instant it reaches the position $$$x_n+1$$$. Since the answer may be very large, output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
