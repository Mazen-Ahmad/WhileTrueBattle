  "statement": "Let $$$\\operatorname{lowbit}(x)$$$ denote the value of the lowest binary bit of $$$x$$$, e.g. $$$\\operatorname{lowbit}(12)=4$$$, $$$\\operatorname{lowbit}(8)=8$$$. For an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, if an array $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ satisfies $$$s_k=\\left(\\sum\\limits_{i=k-\\operatorname{lowbit}(k)+1}^{k}a_i\\right)\\bmod 998\\,244\\,353$$$ for all $$$k$$$, then $$$s$$$ is called the Fenwick Tree of $$$a$$$. Let's denote it as $$$s=f(a)$$$. For a positive integer $$$k$$$ and an array $$$a$$$, $$$f^k(a)$$$ is defined as follows: $$$$$$ f^k(a)= \\begin{cases} f(a)&\\textrm{if }k=1\\\\ f(f^{k-1}(a))&\\textrm{otherwise.}\\\\ \\end{cases} $$$$$$ You are given an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a positive integer $$$k$$$. Find an array $$$a$$$ that satisfies $$$0\\le a_i < 998\\,244\\,353$$$ and $$$f^k(a)=b$$$. It can be proved that an answer always exists. If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two positive integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\le k\\le 10^9$$$), representing the length of the array and the number of times the function $$$f$$$ is performed. The second line of each test case contains an array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0\\le b_i < 998\\,244\\,353$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line, containing a valid array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.",
