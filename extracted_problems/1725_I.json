  "statement": "Pak Chanek has a tree called the key tree. This tree consists of $$$N$$$ vertices and $$$N-1$$$ edges. The edges of the tree are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N-1$$$ with edge $$$i$$$ connecting vertices $$$U_i$$$ and $$$V_i$$$. Initially, each edge of the key tree does not have a weight. Formally, a path with length $$$k$$$ in a graph is a sequence $$$[v_1, e_1, v_2, e_2, v_3, e_3, \\ldots, v_k, e_k, v_{k+1}]$$$ such that: For each $$$i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ is a vertex and $$$e_i$$$ is an edge. For each $$$i$$$, $$$e_i$$$ connects vertices $$$v_i$$$ and $$$v_{i+1}$$$. A circuit is a path that starts and ends on the same vertex. A path in a graph is said to be simple if and only if the path does not use the same edge more than once. Note that a simple path can use the same vertex more than once. The cost of a simple path in a weighted graph is defined as the maximum weight of all edges it traverses. Count the number of distinct undirected weighted graphs that satisfy the following conditions: The graph has $$$N$$$ vertices and $$$2N-2$$$ edges. For each pair of different vertices $$$(x, y)$$$, there exists a simple circuit that goes through vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ in the graph. The weight of each edge in the graph is an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$2N-2$$$ inclusive. Each edge has distinct weights. The graph is formed in a way such that there is a way to assign a weight $$$W_i$$$ to each edge $$$i$$$ in the key tree that satisfies the following conditions: For each pair of edges $$$(i, j)$$$, if $$$i<j$$$, then $$$W_i<W_j$$$. For each pair of different vertex indices $$$(x, y)$$$, the cost of the only simple path from vertex $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$ in the key tree is equal to the minimum cost of a simple circuit that goes through vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ in the graph. Note that the graph is allowed to have multi-edges, but is not allowed to have self-loops. Print the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Two graphs are considered distinct if and only if there exists a triple $$$(a, b, c)$$$ such that there exists an edge that connects vertices $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ with weight $$$c$$$ in one graph, but not in the other.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$N$$$ ($$$2 \\le N \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the key tree. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$N-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$U_i$$$ and $$$V_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le U_i, V_i \\le N$$$) — an edge connecting vertices $$$U_i$$$ and $$$V_i$$$. The graph in the input is a tree.",
