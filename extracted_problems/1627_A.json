  "statement": "There is a grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. Some cells are colored black, and the rest of the cells are colored white. In one operation, you can select some black cell and do exactly one of the following: color all cells in its row black, or color all cells in its column black. You are given two integers $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$. Find the minimum number of operations required to make the cell in row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ black, or determine that it is impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 50$$$; $$$1 \\leq r \\leq n$$$; $$$1 \\leq c \\leq m$$$) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid, and the row and column of the cell you need to turn black, respectively. Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, each containing $$$m$$$ characters. Each of these characters is either ' B ' or ' W ' — a black and a white cell, respectively.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is impossible to make the cell in row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ black, output $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to make the cell in row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ black.",
