  "statement": "Gregor is learning about RSA cryptography, and although he doesn't understand how RSA works, he is now fascinated with prime numbers and factoring them. Gregor's favorite prime number is $$$P$$$. Gregor wants to find two bases of $$$P$$$. Formally, Gregor is looking for two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ which satisfy both of the following properties. $$$P \\bmod a = P \\bmod b$$$, where $$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder when $$$x$$$ is divided by $$$y$$$, and $$$2 \\le a < b \\le P$$$. Help Gregor find two bases of his favorite prime number!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). Each subsequent line contains the integer $$$P$$$ ($$$5 \\le P \\le {10}^9$$$), with $$$P$$$ guaranteed to be prime.",
  "outputFormat": "Your output should consist of $$$t$$$ lines. Each line should consist of two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \\le a < b \\le P$$$). If there are multiple possible solutions, print any.",
