  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of positive integers. You can make this operation multiple (possibly zero) times: Choose two indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$, $$$i \\neq j$$$). Assign $$$a_i := \\lceil \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\rceil$$$. Here $$$\\lceil x \\rceil$$$ denotes $$$x$$$ rounded up to the smallest integer $$$\\geq x$$$. Is it possible to make all array elements equal by some sequence of operations (possibly empty)? If yes, print any way to do it in at most $$$30n$$$ operations. It can be proven, that under the problem constraints, if some way exists to make all elements equal, there exists a way with at most $$$30n$$$ operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow. The first line of each test case description contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$). The second line of each test case description contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed, that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$-1 \\leq q \\leq 30n$$$). If $$$q=-1$$$, there is no solution, otherwise $$$q$$$ is equal to the number of operations. If $$$q \\geq 0$$$, on the next $$$q$$$ lines print two integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$, $$$i \\neq j$$$) — descriptions of operations. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any.",
