  "statement": "I wonder, does the falling rain Forever yearn for it's disdain? Effluvium of the Mind You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Find any permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that the sum $$$\\operatorname{lcm}(1,p_1) + \\operatorname{lcm}(2, p_2) + \\ldots + \\operatorname{lcm}(n, p_n)$$$ is as large as possible. Here $$$\\operatorname{lcm}(x, y)$$$ denotes the least common multiple (LCM) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1\\,000$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The only line for each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$p_n$$$ â€” the permutation with the maximum possible value of $$$\\operatorname{lcm}(1,p_1) + \\operatorname{lcm}(2, p_2) + \\ldots + \\operatorname{lcm}(n, p_n)$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
