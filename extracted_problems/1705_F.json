  "statement": "Mark is administering an online exam consisting of $$$n$$$ true-false questions. However, he has lost all answer keys. He needs a way to retrieve the answers before his client gets infuriated. Fortunately, he has access to the grading system. Thus, for each query, you can input the answers to all $$$n$$$ questions, and the grading system will output how many of them are correct. He doesn't have much time, so he can use the grading system at most $$$675$$$ times. Help Mark determine the answer keys. Note that answer keys are fixed in advance and will not change depending on your queries.",
