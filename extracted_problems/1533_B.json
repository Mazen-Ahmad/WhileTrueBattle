  "statement": "Your friend has created a nearest point function. For a given array of integer points $$$x$$$ ( sorted in ascending order, without any duplicates) and a point $$$y$$$ it can find the nearest point from $$$x$$$ to the point $$$y$$$. In other words, it will find such a point $$$x_i$$$ that $$$|y - x_i|$$$ is the minimum possible, where $$$|a|$$$ is the absolute value of $$$a$$$. For example, if $$$x = [1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11]$$$, the answer for $$$y=3$$$ will be $$$2$$$, the answer for $$$y=5$$$ will be $$$5$$$ and the answer for $$$y=100$$$ will be $$$11$$$. This function is a bit buggy, though. If there are several nearest points to the given one, the function crashes. For example, if $$$x = [1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11]$$$ (as above) and $$$y=6$$$, the function will crash, since points $$$5$$$ and $$$7$$$ are both the nearest points for $$$6$$$. Your task is, for a given array of integer points $$$x$$$ ( sorted in ascending order, without any duplicates), determine if it is possible to cause the function to crash by choosing some integer point $$$y$$$. You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of points in the array $$$x$$$. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le 10^9$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th point in the array $$$x$$$. All points in the array $$$x$$$ are distinct, and the array $$$x$$$ is sorted in ascending order (in other words, $$$x_1 < x_2 < \\ldots < x_n$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over the test cases in the input does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if it is possible to find some integer point $$$y$$$ that will crash the function and NO otherwise.",
