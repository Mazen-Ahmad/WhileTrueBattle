  "statement": "You are given a connected undirected graph, the vertices of which are numbered with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Your task is to minimize the number of pairs of vertices $$$1 \\leq u < v \\leq n$$$ between which there exists a path in this graph. To achieve this, you can remove exactly one edge from the graph. Find the smallest number of pairs of vertices!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of sets of input data. Then follows their description. The first line of each set of input data contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$n - 1 \\leq m \\leq \\min(10^5, \\frac{n \\cdot (n - 1)}{2})$$$) — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n, u \\neq v$$$), indicating that there is an undirected edge in the graph between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected and without multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all sets of input data does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each set of input data, output the smallest number of pairs of reachable vertices, if exactly one edge can be removed.",
