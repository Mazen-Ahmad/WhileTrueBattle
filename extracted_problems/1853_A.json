  "statement": "Call an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ sorted if $$$a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq a_{n-1} \\leq a_n$$$. Ntarsis has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He is allowed to perform one type of operation on it (zero or more times): Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$$$). Add $$$1$$$ to $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_i$$$. Subtract $$$1$$$ from $$$a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, \\ldots, a_n$$$. The values of $$$a$$$ can be negative after an operation. Determine the minimum operations needed to make $$$a$$$ not sorted .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 500$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the values of array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.",
