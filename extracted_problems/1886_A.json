  "statement": "Monocarp has an integer $$$n$$$. He wants to represent his number as a sum of three distinct positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$. Additionally, Monocarp wants none of the numbers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ to be divisible by $$$3$$$. Your task is to help Monocarp to find any valid triplet of distinct positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$, or report that such a triplet does not exist.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of testcases. The only line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{9}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, if there is no valid triplet $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$, print NO on the first line. Otherwise, print YES on the first line. On the second line, print any valid triplet of distinct positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that $$$x + y + z = n$$$, and none of the printed numbers are divisible by $$$3$$$. If there are multiple valid triplets, you can print any of them.",
