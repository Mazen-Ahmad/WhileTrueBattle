  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. You are allowed to perform the following operation on it as many times as you want (0 or more times): Choose $$$2$$$ indices $$$i$$$,$$$j$$$ where $$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$ and replace $$$a_k$$$ for all $$$i \\leq k \\leq j$$$ with $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$ Print the maximum sum of all the elements of the final array that you can obtain in such a way.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
