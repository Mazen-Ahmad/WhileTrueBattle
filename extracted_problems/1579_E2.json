  "statement": "In fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems. You are given an integer array $$$a[1 \\ldots n] = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$$$. Let us consider an empty deque (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements $$$[3, 4, 4]$$$ currently in the deque, adding an element $$$1$$$ to the beginning will produce the sequence $$$[\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4]$$$, and adding the same element to the end will produce $$$[3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}]$$$. The elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with $$$a_1$$$ and finishing with $$$a_n$$$. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end. For example, if we consider an array $$$a = [3, 7, 5, 5]$$$, one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this: $$$\\quad$$$ 1. add $$$3$$$ to the beginning of the deque: deque has a sequence $$$[\\color{red}{3}]$$$ in it; $$$\\quad$$$ 2. add $$$7$$$ to the end of the deque: deque has a sequence $$$[3, \\color{red}{7}]$$$ in it; $$$\\quad$$$ 3. add $$$5$$$ to the end of the deque: deque has a sequence $$$[3, 7, \\color{red}{5}]$$$ in it; $$$\\quad$$$ 4. add $$$5$$$ to the beginning of the deque: deque has a sequence $$$[\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5]$$$ in it; Find the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. An inversion in sequence $$$d$$$ is a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$d_i > d_j$$$. For example, the array $$$d = [5, 3, 7, 5]$$$ has exactly two inversions — $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(3, 4)$$$, since $$$d_1 = 5 > 3 = d_2$$$ and $$$d_3 = 7 > 5 = d_4$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The next $$$2t$$$ lines contain descriptions of the test cases. The first line of each test case description contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — array size. The second line of the description contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$t$$$ lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer — the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after executing the described algorithm.",
