  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ letters, each letter is either ' a ' or ' b '. The letters in the string are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. $$$s[l; r]$$$ is a continuous substring of letters from index $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ of the string inclusive. A string is called balanced if the number of letters ' a ' in it is equal to the number of letters ' b '. For example, strings \" baba \" and \" aabbab \" are balanced and strings \" aaab \" and \" b \" are not. Find any non-empty balanced substring $$$s[l; r]$$$ of string $$$s$$$. Print its $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$). If there is no such substring, then print $$$-1$$$ $$$-1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases. Then the descriptions of $$$t$$$ testcases follow. The first line of the testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the length of the string. The second line of the testcase contains a string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ letters, each letter is either ' a ' or ' b '.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase print two integers. If there exists a non-empty balanced substring $$$s[l; r]$$$, then print $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$). Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$ $$$-1$$$.",
