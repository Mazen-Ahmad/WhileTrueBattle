  "statement": "Dasha, an excellent student, is studying at the best mathematical lyceum in the country. Recently, a mysterious stranger brought $$$n$$$ words consisting of small latin letters $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$ to the lyceum. Since that day, Dasha has been tormented by nightmares . Consider some pair of integers $$$\\langle i, j \\rangle$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le j \\le n$$$). A nightmare is a string for which it is true: It is obtained by concatenation $$$s_{i}s_{j}$$$; Its length is odd ; The number of different letters in it is exactly $$$25$$$; The number of occurrences of each letter that is in the word is odd . For example, if $$$s_i=$$$ \"abcdefg\" and $$$s_j=$$$ \"ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", the pair $$$\\langle i, j \\rangle$$$ creates a nightmare . Dasha will stop having nightmares if she counts their number. There are too many nightmares , so Dasha needs your help. Count the number of different nightmares . Nightmares are called different if the corresponding pairs $$$\\langle i, j \\rangle$$$ are different. The pairs $$$\\langle i_1, j_1 \\rangle$$$ and $$$\\langle i_2, j_2 \\rangle$$$ are called different if $$$i_1 \\neq i_2$$$ or $$$j_1 \\neq j_2$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of words. The following $$$n$$$ lines contain the words $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$, consisting of small latin letters. It is guaranteed that the total length of words does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer — the number of different nightmares .",
