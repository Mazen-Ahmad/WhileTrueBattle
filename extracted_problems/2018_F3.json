  "statement": "NightHawk22 - Isolation ⠀ This is the hard version of the problem. In the three versions, the constraints on $$$n$$$ and the time limit are different. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved. This is the statement of Problem D1B : There are $$$n$$$ cities in a row, numbered $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ left to right. At time $$$1$$$, you conquer exactly one city, called the starting city . At time $$$2, 3, \\ldots, n$$$, you can choose a city adjacent to the ones conquered so far and conquer it. You win if, for each $$$i$$$, you conquer city $$$i$$$ at a time no later than $$$a_i$$$. A winning strategy may or may not exist, also depending on the starting city. How many starting cities allow you to win? For each $$$0 \\leq k \\leq n$$$, count the number of arrays of positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$ for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$; the answer to Problem D1B is $$$k$$$. The answer can be very large, so you have to calculate it modulo a given prime $$$p$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 3000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3000$$$, $$$10^8 \\leq p \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$p$$$ is prime) — the number of cities and the modulo. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n+1$$$ integers: the $$$i$$$-th integer should be the number of arrays that satisfy the conditions for $$$k = i-1$$$.",
