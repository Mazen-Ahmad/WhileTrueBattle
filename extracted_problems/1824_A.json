  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ people taking part in a show about VOCALOID. They will sit in the row of seats, numbered $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. The $$$n$$$ people come and sit in order. Each person occupies a seat in one of three ways: Sit in the seat next to the left of the leftmost person who is already sitting, or if seat $$$1$$$ is taken, then leave the show. If there is no one currently sitting, sit in seat $$$m$$$. Sit in the seat next to the right of the rightmost person who is already sitting, or if seat $$$m$$$ is taken, then leave the show. If there is no one currently sitting, sit in seat $$$1$$$. Sit in the seat numbered $$$x_i$$$. If this seat is taken, then leave the show. Now you want to know what is the maximum number of people that can take a seat, if you can let people into the show in any order?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of people and the number of seats. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$-2 \\le x_i \\le m$$$, $$$x_i \\ne 0$$$), the $$$i$$$-th of which describes the way in which the $$$i$$$-th person occupies a seat: If $$$x_i=-1$$$, then $$$i$$$-th person takes the seat in the first way. If $$$x_i=-2$$$, then $$$i$$$-th person takes the seat in the second way. If $$$x_i > 0$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th person takes a seat in the third way, i.e. he wants to sit in the seat with the number $$$x_i$$$ or leave the show if it is occupied.. It is guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases don't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output a single integer — the maximum number of people who can occupy a seat.",
