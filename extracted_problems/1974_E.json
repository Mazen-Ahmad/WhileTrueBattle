  "statement": "Being a physicist, Charlie likes to plan his life in simple and precise terms. For the next $$$m$$$ months, starting with no money, Charlie will work hard and earn $$$x$$$ pounds per month. For the $$$i$$$-th month $$$(1 \\le i \\le m)$$$, there'll be a single opportunity of paying cost $$$c_i$$$ pounds to obtain happiness $$$h_i$$$. Borrowing is not allowed. Money earned in the $$$i$$$-th month can only be spent in a later $$$j$$$-th month ($$$j>i$$$). Since physicists don't code, help Charlie find the maximum obtainable sum of happiness.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers, $$$m$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 50$$$, $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^8$$$) — the total number of months and the monthly salary. The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers, $$$c_i$$$ and $$$h_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le c_i \\le 10^8$$$, $$$1 \\le h_i \\le 10^3$$$) — the cost and happiness on offer for the $$$i$$$-th month. Note that some happiness may be free ($$$c_i=0$$$ for some $$$i$$$'s). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$\\sum_i h_i$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer, the maximum sum of happiness Charlie could obtain.",
