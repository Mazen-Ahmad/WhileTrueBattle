  "statement": "You are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. Each vertex $$$i$$$ has a value $$$a_i$$$ associated with it. Let us root the tree at some vertex $$$v$$$. The vertex $$$v$$$ is called a distinctive root if the following holds: in all paths that start at $$$v$$$ and end at some other node, all the values encountered are distinct. Two different paths may have values in common but a single path must have all distinct values. Find the number of distinctive roots in the tree.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree. The next line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). The following $$$n-1$$$ lines each contain two space-separated integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u$$$, $$$v \\le n$$$), denoting an edge from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the edges form a tree.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer — the number of distinctive roots in the tree.",
