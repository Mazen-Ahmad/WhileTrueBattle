  "statement": "Shohag has an integer $$$n$$$. Please help him find an increasing integer sequence $$$1 \\le a_1 \\lt a_2 \\lt \\ldots \\lt a_n \\le 100$$$ such that $$$a_i \\bmod i \\neq a_j \\bmod j$$$ $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ is satisfied over all pairs $$$1 \\le i \\lt j \\le n$$$. It can be shown that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$a \\bmod b$$$ denotes the remainder of $$$a$$$ after division by $$$b$$$. For example, $$$7 \\bmod 3 = 1, 8 \\bmod 4 = 0$$$ and $$$69 \\bmod 10 = 9$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 50$$$) — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers — the integer sequence that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the statement. If there are multiple such sequences, output any.",
