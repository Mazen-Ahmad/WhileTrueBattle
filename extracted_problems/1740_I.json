  "statement": "In the world of Compfestnesia, Pak Chanek discovers a secret underground dungeon. Inside it, there is a treasure chest that is surrounded by $$$n$$$ statues that are arranged in a circular manner. The statues are numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ with statue $$$i$$$ being to the left of statue $$$i+1$$$ and statue $$$n-1$$$ being to the left of statue $$$0$$$. Pak Chanek observes that each statue is holding a crystal ball with an integer between $$$0$$$ and $$$m-1$$$ inclusive. Let's say the integer in the crystal ball of statue $$$i$$$ is $$$a_i$$$. The dungeon provides instructions that every integer in the crystal balls must be $$$0$$$ in order to open the treasure chest. To achieve that, Pak Chanek is given an integer $$$k$$$, and he can do zero or more operations. In a single operation, Pak Chanek does the following: Choose exactly $$$k$$$ consecutive statues. In other words, choose the statues $$$p, (p+1) \\bmod n, (p+2) \\bmod n, (p+3) \\bmod n, \\ldots, (p+k-1) \\bmod n$$$ for some chosen index $$$p$$$. Do one of the following: For all chosen statues, change their values of $$$a_i$$$ into $$$(a_i+1) \\bmod m$$$. For all chosen statues, change their values of $$$a_i$$$ into $$$(a_i-1) \\bmod m$$$. Help Pak Chanek find the minimum possible number of operations to open the treasure chest.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n,m \\leq 10^6$$$, $$$nm \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\leq k < n$$$) — the number of statues, the bound of the integers in the crystal balls, and the number of statues that can be operated in a single operation. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_0,a_1,\\ldots,a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i < m$$$) — the integers in the crystal balls.",
  "outputFormat": "If it is possible to perform zero or more operations so that $$$a_0=a_1=\\ldots=a_{n-1}=0$$$, output the minimum number of operations required. Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$.",
