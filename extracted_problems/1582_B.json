  "statement": "Luntik came out for a morning stroll and found an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He calculated the sum $$$s$$$ of the elements of the array ($$$s= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i$$$). Luntik calls a subsequence of the array $$$a$$$ nearly full if the sum of the numbers in that subsequence is equal to $$$s-1$$$. Luntik really wants to know the number of nearly full subsequences of the array $$$a$$$. But he needs to come home so he asks you to solve that problem! A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The next $$$2 \\cdot t$$$ lines contain descriptions of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 60$$$) — the length of the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print the number of nearly full subsequences of the array.",
