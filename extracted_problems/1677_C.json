  "statement": "Tokitsukaze has two colorful tapes. There are $$$n$$$ distinct colors, numbered $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$, and each color appears exactly once on each of the two tapes. Denote the color of the $$$i$$$-th position of the first tape as $$$ca_i$$$, and the color of the $$$i$$$-th position of the second tape as $$$cb_i$$$. Now Tokitsukaze wants to select each color an integer value from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, distinct for all the colors. After that she will put down the color values in each colored position on the tapes. Denote the number of the $$$i$$$-th position of the first tape as $$$numa_i$$$, and the number of the $$$i$$$-th position of the second tape as $$$numb_i$$$. For example, for the above picture, assuming that the color red has value $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq n$$$), it appears at the $$$1$$$-st position of the first tape and the $$$3$$$-rd position of the second tape, so $$$numa_1=numb_3=x$$$. Note that each color $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ should have a distinct value, and the same color which appears in both tapes has the same value. After labeling each color, the beauty of the two tapes is calculated as $$$$$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|numa_i-numb_i|.$$$$$$ Please help Tokitsukaze to find the highest possible beauty.",
  "inputFormat": "The first contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of colors. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$ca_1, ca_2, \\ldots, ca_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq ca_i \\leq n$$$) — the color of each position of the first tape. It is guaranteed that $$$ca$$$ is a permutation. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$cb_1, cb_2, \\ldots, cb_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq cb_i \\leq n$$$) — the color of each position of the second tape. It is guaranteed that $$$cb$$$ is a permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
