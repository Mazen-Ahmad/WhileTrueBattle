  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$. Let's define $$$s(n)$$$ as the string \" BAN \" concatenated $$$n$$$ times. For example, $$$s(1)$$$ = \" BAN \", $$$s(3)$$$ = \" BANBANBAN \". Note that the length of the string $$$s(n)$$$ is equal to $$$3n$$$. Consider $$$s(n)$$$. You can perform the following operation on $$$s(n)$$$ any number of times (possibly zero): Select any two distinct indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ $$$(1 \\leq i, j \\leq 3n, i \\ne j)$$$. Then, swap $$$s(n)_i$$$ and $$$s(n)_j$$$. You want the string \" BAN \" to not appear in $$$s(n)$$$ as a subsequence . What's the smallest number of operations you have to do to achieve this? Also, find one such shortest sequence of operations. A string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 100)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n \\leq 100)$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, in the first line output $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\le m \\le 10^5$$$) — the minimum number of operations required. It's guaranteed that the objective is always achievable in at most $$$10^5$$$ operations under the constraints of the problem. Then, output $$$m$$$ lines. The $$$k$$$-th of these lines should contain two integers $$$i_k$$$, $$$j_k$$$ $$$(1\\leq i_k, j_k \\leq 3n, i_k \\ne j_k)$$$ denoting that you want to swap characters at indices $$$i_k$$$ and $$$j_k$$$ at the $$$k$$$-th operation. After all $$$m$$$ operations, \" BAN \" must not appear in $$$s(n)$$$ as a subsequence. If there are multiple possible answers, output any.",
