  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a positive integer $$$k$$$, but some parts of the array $$$a$$$ are missing. Your task is to fill the missing part so that the maximum subarray sum $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$a$$$ is exactly $$$k$$$, or report that no solution exists. Formally, you are given a binary string $$$s$$$ and a partially filled array $$$a$$$, where: If you remember the value of $$$a_i$$$, $$$s_i = 1$$$ to indicate that, and you are given the real value of $$$a_i$$$. If you don't remember the value of $$$a_i$$$, $$$s_i = 0$$$ to indicate that, and you are given $$$a_i = 0$$$. All the values that you remember satisfy $$$|a_i| \\le 10^6$$$. However, you may use values up to $$$10^{18}$$$ to fill in the values that you do not remember. It can be proven that if a solution exists, a solution also exists satisfying $$$|a_i| \\le 10^{18}$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The maximum subarray sum of an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, i.e. $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n$$$ is defined as $$$\\max_{1 \\le i \\le j \\le n} S(i, j)$$$ where $$$S(i, j) = a_i + a_{i + 1} + \\ldots + a_j$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two numbers $$$n,k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5,1 \\le k \\le 10^{12}$$$). The second line of each test case contains a binary ($$$\\texttt{01}$$$) string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$|a_i| \\le 10^6$$$). If $$$s_i = \\texttt{0}$$$, then it's guaranteed that $$$a_i = 0$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, first output $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$ if a solution exists or $$$\\texttt{No}$$$ if no solution exists. You may print each character in either case, for example $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{yEs}$$$ will also be accepted. If there's at least one solution, print $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ on the second line. $$$|a_i| \\le 10^{18}$$$ must hold.",
