  "statement": "On a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, we define a bully swap as follows: Let $$$i$$$ be the index of the largest element $$$p_i$$$ such that $$$p_i \\neq i$$$. Let $$$j$$$ be the index of the smallest element $$$p_j$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$. Swap $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$. We define $$$f(p)$$$ as the number of bully swaps we need to perform until $$$p$$$ becomes sorted. Note that if $$$p$$$ is the identity permutation, $$$f(p)=0$$$. You are given $$$n$$$ and a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You need to process the following $$$q$$$ updates. In each update, you are given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. You will swap $$$p_x$$$ and $$$p_y$$$ and then find the value of $$$f(p)$$$. Note that the updates are persistent. Changes made to the permutation $$$p$$$ will apply when processing future updates.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le q \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the length of the permutation and the number of updates. The second line of input contains $$$n$$$ integer $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$) — the permutation $$$p$$$. All elements of $$$p$$$ are distinct. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines of input contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i < y_i \\le n$$$) — describing the $$$i$$$-th update.",
  "outputFormat": "After each update, output $$$f(p)$$$.",
