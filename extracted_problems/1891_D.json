  "statement": "Let $$$f$$$($$$x$$$) be the floor of the binary logarithm of $$$x$$$. In other words, $$$f$$$($$$x$$$) is largest non-negative integer $$$y$$$, such that $$$2^y$$$ does not exceed $$$x$$$. Let $$$g$$$($$$x$$$) be the floor of the logarithm of $$$x$$$ with base $$$f$$$($$$x$$$). In other words, $$$g$$$($$$x$$$) is the largest non-negative integer $$$z$$$, such that $$${f(x)}^{z}$$$ does not exceed $$$x$$$. You are given $$$q$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query consists of two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$. The answer to the query is the sum of $$$g$$$($$$k$$$) across all integers $$$k$$$, such that $$$l_i \\leq k \\leq r_i$$$. Since the answers might be large, print them modulo $$${10^9 + 7}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ — the number of queries ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$$$). The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ — the bounds of the $$$i$$$-th query ($$$4 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq 10^{18}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, output the answer to the query modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
