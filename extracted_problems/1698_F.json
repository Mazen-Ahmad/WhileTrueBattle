  "statement": "There is an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You may perform the following operation on it: Choose two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ where $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$ and $$$a_l = a_r$$$. Then, reverse the subsegment from the $$$l$$$-th to the $$$r$$$-th element, i. e. set $$$[a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_{r - 1}, a_r]$$$ to $$$[a_r, a_{r-1}, \\ldots, a_{l+1}, a_l]$$$. You are also given another array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ which is a permutation of $$$a$$$. Find a sequence of at most $$$n^2$$$ operations that transforms array $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$, or report that no such sequence exists.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 500$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le n$$$) — elements of the array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$b$$$ is a permutation of $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" NO \" (without quotes) if it is impossible to turn $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$ using at most $$$n^2$$$ operations. Otherwise, output \" YES \" (without quotes). Then output an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\leq k \\leq n^2$$$) denoting the number of operations you will perform. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations. Afterwards, output $$$k$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$) — the left and right indices for the $$$i$$$-th operation. You can output \" YES \" and \" NO \" in any case (for example, strings \" yEs \", \" yes \" and \" Yes \" will be recognized as a positive response). If there are multiple possible sequences of operations, you may output any of them.",
