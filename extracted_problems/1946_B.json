  "statement": "You have an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. You perform exactly $$$k$$$ operations on it. In one operation, you select any contiguous subarray of the array $$$a$$$ (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after $$$k$$$ such operations. As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. Reminder: the remainder of a number $$$x$$$ modulo $$$p$$$ is the smallest non-negative $$$y$$$ such that there exists an integer $$$q$$$ and $$$x = p \\cdot q + y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of operations, respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$ itself. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can be obtained after $$$k$$$ operations modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
