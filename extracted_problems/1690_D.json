  "statement": "You have a stripe of checkered paper of length $$$n$$$. Each cell is either white or black. What is the minimum number of cells that must be recolored from white to black in order to have a segment of $$$k$$$ consecutive black cells on the stripe? If the input data is such that a segment of $$$k$$$ consecutive black cells already exists, then print 0 .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Next, descriptions of $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$$$). The second line consists of the letters ' W ' (white) and ' B ' (black). The line length is $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each of $$$t$$$ test cases print an integer — the minimum number of cells that need to be repainted from white to black in order to have a segment of $$$k$$$ consecutive black cells.",
