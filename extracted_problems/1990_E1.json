  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is the limit on the number of queries. This is an interactive problem. You are given a tree of $$$n$$$ nodes with node $$$1$$$ as its root node. There is a hidden mole in one of the nodes. To find its position, you can pick an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le n$$$) to make an inquiry to the jury. Next, the jury will return $$$1$$$ when the mole is in subtree $$$x$$$. Otherwise, the judge will return $$$0$$$. If the judge returns $$$0$$$ and the mole is not in root node $$$1$$$, the mole will move to the parent node of the node it is currently on. Use at most $$$300$$$ operations to find the current node where the mole is located.",
