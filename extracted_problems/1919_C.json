  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. You will do the following process to calculate your penalty: Split array $$$a$$$ into two (possibly empty) subsequences$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ such that every element of $$$a$$$ is either in $$$s$$$ or $$$t^\\ddagger$$$. For an array $$$b$$$ of size $$$m$$$, define the penalty $$$p(b)$$$ of an array $$$b$$$ as the number of indices $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$m - 1$$$ where $$$b_i < b_{i + 1}$$$. The total penalty you will receive is $$$p(s) + p(t)$$$. If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty you will receive. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. $$$^\\ddagger$$$ Some valid ways to split array $$$a=[3,1,4,1,5]$$$ into $$$(s,t)$$$ are $$$([3,4,1,5],[1])$$$, $$$([1,1],[3,4,5])$$$ and $$$([\\,],[3,1,4,1,5])$$$ while some invalid ways to split $$$a$$$ are $$$([3,4,5],[1])$$$, $$$([3,1,4,1],[1,5])$$$ and $$$([1,3,4],[5,1])$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
