  "statement": "Polycarp had an array $$$a$$$ of $$$3$$$ positive integers. He wrote out the sums of all non-empty subsequences of this array, sorted them in non-decreasing order, and got an array $$$b$$$ of $$$7$$$ integers. For example, if $$$a = \\{1, 4, 3\\}$$$, then Polycarp wrote out $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$1 + 4 = 5$$$, $$$1 + 3 = 4$$$, $$$4 + 3 = 7$$$, $$$1 + 4 + 3 = 8$$$. After sorting, he got an array $$$b = \\{1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8\\}.$$$ Unfortunately, Polycarp lost the array $$$a$$$. He only has the array $$$b$$$ left. Help him to restore the array $$$a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line which contains $$$7$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_7$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$; $$$b_i \\le b_{i+1}$$$). Additional constraint on the input: there exists at least one array $$$a$$$ which yields this array $$$b$$$ as described in the statement .",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$3$$$ integers — $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$. If there can be several answers, print any of them.",
