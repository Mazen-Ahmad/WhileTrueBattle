  "statement": "bright, sunny and innocent...... Tenzing has a beautiful necklace. The necklace consists of $$$n$$$ pearls numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ with a string connecting pearls $$$i$$$ and $$$(i \\text{ mod } n)+1$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. One day Tenzing wants to cut the necklace into several parts by cutting some strings. But for each connected part of the necklace, there should not be more than $$$k$$$ pearls. The time needed to cut each string may not be the same. Tenzing needs to spend $$$a_i$$$ minutes cutting the string between pearls $$$i$$$ and $$$(i \\text{ mod } n)+1$$$. Tenzing wants to know the minimum time in minutes to cut the necklace such that each connected part will not have more than $$$k$$$ pearls.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 5\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\leq k <n$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ of all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
