  "statement": "Alice, Bob and Charlie want to share a rectangular cake cut into $$$n$$$ pieces. Each person considers every piece to be worth a different value. The $$$i$$$-th piece is considered to be of value $$$a_i$$$ by Alice, $$$b_i$$$ by Bob and $$$c_i$$$ by Charlie. The sum over all $$$a_i$$$, all $$$b_i$$$ and all $$$c_i$$$ individually is the same, equal to $$$tot$$$. Given the values of each piece of the cake for each person, you need to give each person a contiguous slice of cake. In other words, the indices at the left and right ends of these subarrays (the slices given to each person) can be represented as $$$(l_a, r_a)$$$, $$$(l_b, r_b)$$$ and $$$(l_c, r_c)$$$ respectively for Alice, Bob and Charlie. The division needs to satisfy the following constraints: No piece is assigned to more than one person, i.e., no two subarrays among $$$[l_a,\\ldots,r_a]$$$, $$$[l_b, \\ldots, r_b]$$$ and $$$[l_c, \\ldots, r_c]$$$ intersect. $$$ \\sum_{i = l_a}^{r_a} a_i, \\sum_{i = l_b}^{r_b} b_i, \\sum_{i = l_c}^{r_c} c_i \\geq \\lceil \\frac{tot}{3} \\rceil$$$. Here, the notation $$$\\lceil \\frac{a}{b} \\rceil$$$ represents ceiling division. It is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to the exact division of $$$a$$$ by $$$b$$$. In other words, it rounds up the division result to the nearest integer. For instance $$$\\lceil \\frac{10}{3} \\rceil = 4$$$ and $$$\\lceil \\frac{15}{3} \\rceil = 5$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$, the number of testcases, ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) For each testcase: The first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The following three lines contain $$$n$$$ integers each: One line with $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ represents the values for Alice ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$). The next line with $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ represents the values for Bob ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^6$$$). The next line with $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$$$ represents the values for Charlie ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$ \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_i = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} b_i = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_i$$$. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, output $$$-1$$$ if the required condition is impossible. Otherwise, output six numbers â€“ $$$l_a, r_a, l_b, r_b, l_c, r_c$$$, the respective starting and ending indices ($$$1$$$-indexed) of the subarrays for Alice, Bob and Charlie, respectively.",
