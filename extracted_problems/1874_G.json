  "statement": "Jellyfish loves playing a game called \"Inscryption\" which is played on a directed acyclic graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. All edges $$$a \\to b$$$ satisfy $$$a < b$$$. You need to move from vertex $$$1$$$ to vertex $$$n$$$ along the directed edges, and then fight with the final boss. You will collect cards and props in the process. Each card has two attributes: HP and damage. If a card's HP is $$$a$$$ and its damage is $$$b$$$, then the power of the card is $$$a \\times b$$$. Each prop has only one attribute: power. In addition to vertex $$$1$$$ and vertex $$$n$$$, there are some vertices that trigger special events. The special events are: You will get a card with $$$a$$$ HP, and $$$b$$$ damage. If you have at least one card , choose one of your cards and increase its HP by $$$x$$$. If you have at least one card , choose one of your cards and increase its damage by $$$y$$$. You will get a prop with $$$w$$$ power. When you get to vertex $$$n$$$, you can choose at most one of your cards and multiply its damage by $$$10^9$$$. The final boss is very strong, so you want to maximize the sum of the power of all your cards and props . Find the maximum possible sum of power of all your cards and props if you play the game optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 200$$$, $$$n - 1\\leq m \\leq \\min(\\frac{n(n-1)}2, 2000)$$$) — the number of the vertices and the number of the edges. In the following $$$n$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th $$$(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$$$ line describes the special event that will trigger on vertex $$$i$$$: 0 — no special events. 1 a b ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq 200$$$) — you will get a card with $$$a$$$ HP, and $$$b$$$ damage. 2 x ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq 200$$$) — if you have at least one card, choose one of your cards and increase its HP by $$$x$$$. 3 y ($$$1 \\leq y \\leq 200$$$) — if you have at least one card, choose one of your cards and increase its damage by $$$y$$$. 4 w ($$$1 \\leq w \\leq 10^6$$$) — you will get a prop with $$$w$$$ power. In the following $$$m$$$ lines, each line contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u < v \\leq n$$$) representing a directed edge from vertex $$$u$$$ to vertex $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that every edge $$$(u,v)$$$ appears at most once. It is guaranteed that there are no special events on vertex $$$1$$$ and vertex $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that for all $$$i$$$, there exists a path from vertex $$$1$$$ to vertex $$$n$$$ that passes through vertex $$$i$$$.",
