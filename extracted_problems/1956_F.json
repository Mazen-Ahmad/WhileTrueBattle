  "statement": "Nene is training her team as a basketball coach. Nene's team consists of $$$n$$$ players, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th player has an arm interval $$$[l_i,r_i]$$$. Two players $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \\neq j$$$) can pass the ball to each other if and only if $$$|i-j|\\in[l_i+l_j,r_i+r_j]$$$ (here, $$$|x|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$x$$$). Nene wants to test the cooperation ability of these players. In order to do this, she will hold several rounds of assessment. In each round, Nene will select a sequence of players $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_m$$$ such that players $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$ can pass the ball to each other for all $$$1 \\le i < m$$$. The length of the sequence $$$m$$$ can be chosen by Nene. Each player can appear in the sequence $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_m$$$ multiple times or not appear in it at all. Then, Nene will throw a ball to player $$$p_1$$$, player $$$p_1$$$ will pass the ball to player $$$p_2$$$ and so on... Player $$$p_m$$$ will throw a ball away from the basketball court so it can no longer be used. As a coach, Nene wants each of $$$n$$$ players to appear in at least one round of assessment. Since Nene has to go on a date after school, Nene wants you to calculate the minimum number of rounds of assessment needed to complete the task.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$). The description of test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot 10^6$$$) — the number of players. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1\\leq l_i\\leq r_i\\leq n$$$) — the arm interval of the $$$i$$$-th player. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of rounds of assessment Nene needs to complete her work.",
