  "statement": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. They start with a positive integer $$$n$$$ and take alternating turns doing operations on it. Each turn a player can subtract from $$$n$$$ one of its divisors that isn't $$$1$$$ or $$$n$$$. The player who cannot make a move on his/her turn loses. Alice always moves first. Note that they subtract a divisor of the current number in each turn. You are asked to find out who will win the game if both players play optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$$$) — the initial number.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output \" Alice \" if Alice will win the game or \" Bob \" if Bob will win, if both players play optimally.",
