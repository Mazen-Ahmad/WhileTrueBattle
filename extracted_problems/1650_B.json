  "statement": "Not so long ago, Vlad came up with an interesting function: $$$f_a(x)=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{a}\\right\\rfloor + x \\bmod a$$$, where $$$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{a}\\right\\rfloor$$$ is $$$\\frac{x}{a}$$$, rounded down , $$$x \\bmod a$$$ — the remainder of the integer division of $$$x$$$ by $$$a$$$. For example, with $$$a=3$$$ and $$$x=11$$$, the value $$$f_3(11) = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{11}{3}\\right\\rfloor + 11 \\bmod 3 = 3 + 2 = 5$$$. The number $$$a$$$ is fixed and known to Vlad. Help Vlad find the maximum value of $$$f_a(x)$$$ if $$$x$$$ can take any integer value from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive ($$$l \\le x \\le r$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of input test cases. This is followed by $$$t$$$ lines, each of which contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ and $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 10^9, 1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the left and right boundaries of the segment and the fixed value of $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one number on a separate line — the maximum value of the function on a given segment for a given $$$a$$$.",
