  "statement": "Alice and Bob were playing a game again. They have a grid of size $$$a \\times b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$), on which there are $$$n$$$ chips, with at most one chip in each cell. The cell at the intersection of the $$$x$$$-th row and the $$$y$$$-th column has coordinates $$$(x, y)$$$. Alice made the first move, and the players took turns. On each move, a player could cut several (but not all) rows or columns from the beginning or end of the remaining grid and earn a point for each chip that was on the cut part of the grid. Each move can be described by the character ' U ', ' D ', ' L ', or ' R ' and an integer $$$k$$$: If the character is ' U ', then the first $$$k$$$ remaining rows will be cut; If the character is ' D ', then the last $$$k$$$ remaining rows will be cut; If the character is ' L ', then the first $$$k$$$ remaining columns will be cut; If the character is ' R ', then the last $$$k$$$ remaining columns will be cut. Based on the initial state of the grid and the players' moves, determine the number of points earned by Alice and Bob, respectively.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$n$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the dimensions of the grid, the number of chips, and the number of moves. Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le a$$$, $$$1 \\le y_i \\le b$$$) — the coordinates of the chips. All pairs of coordinates are distinct. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contain a character $$$c_j$$$ and an integer $$$k_j$$$ — the description of the $$$j$$$-th move. It is guaranteed that $$$k$$$ is less than the number of rows/columns in the current grid. In other words, a player cannot cut the entire remaining grid on their move. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases in the test does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$m$$$ across all test cases in the test does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output two integers — the number of points earned by Alice and Bob, respectively.",
