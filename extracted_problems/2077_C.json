  "statement": "Last | Moment - onoken For a binary string$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$v$$$, the score of $$$v$$$ is defined as the maximum value of $$$$$$F\\big(v, 1, i\\big) \\cdot F\\big(v, i+1, |v|\\big)$$$$$$ over all $$$i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq i \\leq |v|$$$). Here, $$$F\\big(v, l, r\\big) = r - l + 1 - 2 \\cdot \\operatorname{zero}(v, l, r)$$$, where $$$\\operatorname{zero}(v, l, r)$$$ denotes the number of $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$s in $$$v_lv_{l+1} \\ldots v_r$$$. If $$$l > r$$$, then $$$F\\big(v, l, r\\big) = 0$$$. You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a positive integer $$$q$$$. You will be asked $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, you are given an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$). You must flip $$$s_i$$$ from $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ to $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ (or from $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ to $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$). Find the sum of the scores over all non-empty subsequences$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ of $$$s$$$ after each modification query. Since the result may be large, output the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Note that the modifications are persistent. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A binary string is a string that consists only of the characters $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A binary string $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a binary string $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deleting several (possibly zero or all) characters.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$ and the number of modification queries, respectively. The second line contains the binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$. The following $$$q$$$ lines each contain an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$), indicating that $$$s_i$$$ is flipped from $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ to $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ or from $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ to $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$. It is guaranteed that neither the total sum of all values of $$$n$$$ nor the total sum of all values of $$$q$$$ across all test cases exceeds $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$q$$$ lines, each line containing a single integer — the required sum modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
