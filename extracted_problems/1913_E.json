  "statement": "You are given a matrix $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ rows by $$$m$$$ columns. Each element of the matrix is equal to $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose an element of the matrix and replace it with either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. You are also given two arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ (of length $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ respectively). After you perform the operations, the matrix should satisfy the following conditions: the number of ones in the $$$i$$$-th row of the matrix should be exactly $$$A_i$$$ for every $$$i \\in [1, n]$$$. the number of ones in the $$$j$$$-th column of the matrix should be exactly $$$B_j$$$ for every $$$j \\in [1, m]$$$. Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n, m \\le 50$$$). Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\dots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_{i,j} \\le 1$$$). The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$$$ ($$$0\\le A_i\\le m$$$). The next line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_m$$$ ($$$0\\le B_i\\le n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer â€” the minimum number of operations you have to perform, or -1 if it is impossible.",
