  "statement": "You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer is either $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, or $$$2$$$. Initially, each element of the array is blue. Your goal is to paint each element of the array red. In order to do so, you can perform operations of two types: pay one coin to choose a blue element and paint it red; choose a red element which is not equal to $$$0$$$ and a blue element adjacent to it, decrease the chosen red element by $$$1$$$, and paint the chosen blue element red. What is the minimum number of coins you have to spend to achieve your goal?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 2$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer â€” the minimum number of coins you have to spend in order to paint all elements red.",
