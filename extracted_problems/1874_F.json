  "statement": "Jellyfish always uses OEIS to solve math problems, but now she finds a problem that cannot be solved by OEIS: Count the number of permutations $$$p$$$ of $$$[1, 2, \\dots, n]$$$ such that for all $$$(l, r)$$$ such that $$$l \\leq r \\leq m_l$$$, the subarray $$$[p_l, p_{l+1}, \\dots, p_r]$$$ is not a permutation of $$$[l, l+1, \\dots, r]$$$. Since the answer may be large, you only need to find the answer modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 200$$$) â€” the length of the permutation. The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq m_i \\leq n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Output the number of different permutations that satisfy the conditions, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
