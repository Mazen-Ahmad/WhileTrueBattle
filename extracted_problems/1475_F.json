  "statement": "You are given two binary square matrices $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of size $$$n \\times n$$$. A matrix is called binary if each of its elements is equal to $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. You can do the following operations on the matrix $$$a$$$ arbitrary number of times (0 or more): vertical xor . You choose the number $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j \\le n$$$) and for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) do the following: $$$a_{i, j} := a_{i, j} \\oplus 1$$$ ($$$\\oplus$$$ — is the operation xor (exclusive or)). horizontal xor . You choose the number $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) and for all $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j \\le n$$$) do the following: $$$a_{i, j} := a_{i, j} \\oplus 1$$$. Note that the elements of the $$$a$$$ matrix change after each operation. For example, if $$$n=3$$$ and the matrix $$$a$$$ is: $$$$$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$$$$$ Then the following sequence of operations shows an example of transformations: vertical xor , $$$j=1$$$. $$$$$$ a= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$$$$$ horizontal xor , $$$i=2$$$. $$$$$$ a= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$$$$$ vertical xor , $$$j=2$$$. $$$$$$ a= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$$$$$ Check if there is a sequence of operations such that the matrix $$$a$$$ becomes equal to the matrix $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$) — the size of the matrices. The following $$$n$$$ lines contain strings of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters ' 0 ' and ' 1 ' — the description of the matrix $$$a$$$. An empty line follows. The following $$$n$$$ lines contain strings of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters ' 0 ' and ' 1 ' — the description of the matrix $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output on a separate line: \" YES \", there is such a sequence of operations that the matrix $$$a$$$ becomes equal to the matrix $$$b$$$; \" NO \" otherwise. You can output \" YES \" and \" NO \" in any case (for example, the strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).",
