  "statement": "Kevin has recently learned the definition of variance. For an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, the variance of $$$a$$$ is defined as follows: Let $$$x=\\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$$$, i.e., $$$x$$$ is the mean of the array $$$a$$$; Then, the variance of $$$a$$$ is $$$$$$ V(a)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-x)^2. $$$$$$ Now, Kevin gives you an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers, as well as an integer $$$k$$$. You can perform the following operation on $$$a$$$: Select an interval $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1\\le l\\le r\\le n$$$), then for each $$$l\\le i\\le r$$$, increase $$$a_i$$$ by $$$k$$$. For each $$$1\\le p\\le m$$$, you have to find the minimum possible variance of $$$a$$$ after exactly $$$p$$$ operations are performed, independently for each $$$p$$$. For simplicity, you only need to output the answers multiplied by $$$n^2$$$. It can be proven that the results are always integers.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\le n,m\\le 5000$$$, $$$\\color{red}{n\\cdot m\\le 2\\cdot 10^4}$$$, $$$1\\le k\\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$, the maximum number of operations, and the number you add to $$$a_i$$$ each time, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le 10^5$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n\\cdot m$$$ over all tests does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$m$$$ integers in a single line, the $$$p$$$-th integer denoting the minimum possible variance of $$$a$$$ when exactly $$$p$$$ operations are performed, multiplied by $$$n^2$$$.",
