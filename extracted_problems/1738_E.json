  "statement": "Given an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, your task is to compute the number, modulo $$$998244353$$$, of ways to partition it into several non-empty continuous subsequences such that the sums of elements in the subsequences form a balanced sequence. A sequence $$$s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k$$$ of length $$$k$$$ is said to be balanced , if $$$s_{i} = s_{k-i+1}$$$ for every $$$1 \\leq i \\leq k$$$. For example, $$$[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]$$$ and $$$[1,3,3,1]$$$ are balanced, but $$$[1,5,15]$$$ is not. Formally, every partition can be described by a sequence of indexes $$$i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k$$$ of length $$$k$$$ with $$$1 = i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\leq n$$$ such that $$$k$$$ is the number of non-empty continuous subsequences in the partition; For every $$$1 \\leq j \\leq k$$$, the $$$j$$$-th continuous subsequence starts with $$$a_{i_j}$$$, and ends exactly before $$$a_{i_{j+1}}$$$, where $$$i_{k+1} = n + 1$$$. That is, the $$$j$$$-th subsequence is $$$a_{i_j}, a_{i_j+1}, \\dots, a_{i_{j+1}-1}$$$. There are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ different partitions in total. Let $$$s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k$$$ denote the sums of elements in the subsequences with respect to the partition $$$i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k$$$. Formally, for every $$$1 \\leq j \\leq k$$$, $$$$$$ s_j = \\sum_{i=i_{j}}^{i_{j+1}-1} a_i = a_{i_j} + a_{i_j+1} + \\dots + a_{i_{j+1}-1}. $$$$$$ For example, the partition $$$[1\\,|\\,2,3\\,|\\,4,5,6]$$$ of sequence $$$[1,2,3,4,5,6]$$$ is described by the sequence $$$[1,2,4]$$$ of indexes, and the sums of elements in the subsequences with respect to the partition is $$$[1,5,15]$$$. Two partitions $$$i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k$$$ and $$$i'_1, i'_2, \\dots, i'_{k'}$$$ (described by sequences of indexes) are considered to be different, if at least one of the following holds. $$$k \\neq k'$$$, $$$i_j \\neq i'_j$$$ for some $$$1 \\leq j \\leq \\min\\left\\{ k, k' \\right\\}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$), indicating the length of the sequence $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$), indicating the elements of the sequence $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the number of partitions with respect to which the sum of elements in each subsequence is balanced, modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
