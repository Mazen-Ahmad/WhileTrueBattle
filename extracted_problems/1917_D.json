  "statement": "You are given a permutation $$$p_0, p_1, \\ldots, p_{n-1}$$$ of odd integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n-1$$$ and a permutation $$$q_0, q_1, \\ldots, q_{k-1}$$$ of integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$k-1$$$. An array $$$a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_{nk-1}$$$ of length $$$nk$$$ is defined as follows: $$$a_{i \\cdot k+j}=p_i \\cdot 2^{q_j}$$$ for all $$$0 \\le i < n$$$ and all $$$0 \\le j < k$$$ For example, if $$$p = [3, 5, 1]$$$ and $$$q = [0, 1]$$$, then $$$a = [3, 6, 5, 10, 1, 2]$$$. Note that all arrays in the statement are zero-indexed. Note that each element of the array $$$a$$$ is uniquely determined. Find the number of inversions in the array $$$a$$$. Since this number can be very large, you should find only its remainder modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. An inversion in array $$$a$$$ is a pair $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$0 \\le i < j < nk$$$) such that $$$a_i > a_j$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the lengths of arrays $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_0, p_1, \\ldots, p_{n-1}$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le 2n-1$$$, $$$p_i$$$ is odd) — the array $$$p$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$q_0, q_1, \\ldots, q_{k-1}$$$ ($$$0 \\le q_i < k$$$) — the array $$$q$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer: the number of inversions in array $$$a$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
