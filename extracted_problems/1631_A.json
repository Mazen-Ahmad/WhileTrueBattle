  "statement": "You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers each. You can apply the following operation to them any number of times: Select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\leq i\\leq n$$$) and swap $$$a_i$$$ with $$$b_i$$$ (i. e. $$$a_i$$$ becomes $$$b_i$$$ and vice versa). Find the minimum possible value of $$$\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\cdot \\max(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n)$$$ you can get after applying such operation any number of times (possibly zero).",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 100$$$) — the length of the arrays. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10\\,000$$$) where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of the array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10\\,000$$$) where $$$b_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of the array $$$b$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer, the minimum possible value of $$$\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\cdot \\max(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n)$$$ you can get after applying such operation any number of times.",
