  "statement": "Initially, you have a coin with value $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): transform one coin with value $$$x$$$, where $$$x$$$ is greater than $$$3$$$ ($$$x>3$$$), into two coins with value $$$\\lfloor \\frac{x}{4} \\rfloor$$$. What is the maximum number of coins you can have after performing this operation any number of times?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of coins you can have after performing the operation any number of times.",
