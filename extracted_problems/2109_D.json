  "statement": "Of course, a problem with the letter D is sponsored by Declan Akaba. You are given a simple, connected, undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. The graph contains no self-loops or multiple edges. You are also given a multiset $$$A$$$ consisting of $$$\\ell$$$ elements: $$$$$$ A = \\{A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_\\ell\\} $$$$$$ Starting from vertex $$$1$$$, you may perform the following move any number of times, as long as the multiset $$$A$$$ is not empty: Select an element $$$k \\in A$$$ and remove it from the multiset . You must remove exactly one occurrence of $$$k$$$ from $$$A$$$. Traverse any walk$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of exactly $$$k$$$ edges to reach some vertex (possibly the same one you started from). For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$), determine whether there exists a sequence of such moves that starts at vertex $$$1$$$ and ends at vertex $$$i$$$, using the original multiset $$$A$$$. Note that the check for each vertex $$$i$$$ is independent — you restart from vertex $$$1$$$ and use the original multiset $$$A$$$ for each case. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A walk of length $$$k$$$ is a sequence of vertices $$$v_0, v_1, \\ldots, v_{k - 1}, v_k$$$ such that each consecutive pair of vertices $$$(v_i, v_{i + 1})$$$ is connected by an edge in the graph. The sequence may include repeated vertices.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$\\ell$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n-1 \\leq m \\leq 4 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq \\ell \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the size of the multiset, respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$\\ell$$$ integers $$$A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{\\ell}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^4$$$) — the elements of the multiset. Each of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u < v \\le n$$$) — the endpoints of an edge in the graph. It is guaranteed that the edges form a simple, connected graph without self-loops or multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$, the sum of $$$m$$$, and the sum of $$$\\ell$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$4 \\cdot 10^5$$$, and $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, respectively.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a binary string of length $$$n$$$, where the $$$i$$$-th character is $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ if there exists a sequence of moves ending at vertex $$$i$$$, and $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ otherwise.",
