  "statement": "Sparkle gives you two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Initially, your score is $$$0$$$. In one operation, you can choose an integer $$$i$$$ and add $$$a_i$$$ to your score. Then, you must set $$$a_i$$$ = $$$\\max(0, a_i - b_i)$$$. You only have time to perform $$$k$$$ operations before Sparkle sets off a nuclear bomb! What is the maximum score you can acquire after $$$k$$$ operations?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the arrays and the number of operations you can perform. The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, ... a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, ... b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
