  "statement": "You're given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Find a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ such that for any $$$1 \\leq l < r \\leq n$$$, the sum $$$a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_r$$$ is not divisible by $$$r-l+1$$$. A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contain a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the size of the desired permutation.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no such permutation print $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, print $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_{2}, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$) — a permutation satisfying the condition described in the statement. If there are multiple solutions, print any.",
