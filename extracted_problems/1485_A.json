  "statement": "You have two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. You can perform two kinds of operations: $$$a = \\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\rfloor$$$ (replace $$$a$$$ with the integer part of the division between $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$) $$$b=b+1$$$ (increase $$$b$$$ by $$$1$$$) Find the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a=0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The only line of the description of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a,b \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer: the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a=0$$$.",
