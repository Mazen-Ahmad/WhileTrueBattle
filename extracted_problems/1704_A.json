  "statement": "AquaMoon has two binary sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, which contain only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. AquaMoon can perform the following two operations any number of times ($$$a_1$$$ is the first element of $$$a$$$, $$$a_2$$$ is the second element of $$$a$$$, and so on): Operation 1 : if $$$a$$$ contains at least two elements, change $$$a_2$$$ to $$$\\operatorname{min}(a_1,a_2)$$$, and remove the first element of $$$a$$$. Operation 2 : if $$$a$$$ contains at least two elements, change $$$a_2$$$ to $$$\\operatorname{max}(a_1,a_2)$$$, and remove the first element of $$$a$$$. Note that after a removal of the first element of $$$a$$$, the former $$$a_2$$$ becomes the first element of $$$a$$$, the former $$$a_3$$$ becomes the second element of $$$a$$$ and so on, and the length of $$$a$$$ reduces by one. Determine if AquaMoon can make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$ by using these operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,m \\leq 50$$$, $$$m \\leq n$$$) — the lengths of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ respectively. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. The third line of each test case contains a string $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$, consisting only $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \"YES\" if AquaMoon can change $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ by using these options; otherwise, output \"NO\". You may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as a positive answer).",
