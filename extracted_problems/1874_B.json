  "statement": "Jellyfish is given the non-negative integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ and $$$m$$$. Initially $$$(x,y)=(a,b)$$$. Jellyfish wants to do several operations so that $$$(x,y)=(c,d)$$$. For each operation, she can do one of the following: $$$x := x\\,\\&\\,y$$$, $$$x := x\\,|\\,y$$$, $$$y := x \\oplus y$$$, $$$y := y \\oplus m$$$. Here $$$\\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation , $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation and $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation . Now Jellyfish asks you for the minimum number of operations such that $$$(x,y)=(c,d)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains five integers, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a, b, c, d, m < 2^{30}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer â€” the minimum number of operations. If this cannot be achieved, output $$$-1$$$ instead.",
