  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers and a score. If your score is greater than or equal to $$$a_i$$$, then you can increase your score by $$$a_i$$$ and remove $$$a_i$$$ from the array. For each index $$$i$$$, output the maximum number of additional array elements that you can remove if you remove $$$a_i$$$ and then set your score to $$$a_i$$$. Note that the removal of $$$a_i$$$ should not be counted in the answer.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$-th of which denotes the maximum number of additional array elements that you can remove if you remove $$$a_i$$$ from the array and then set your score to $$$a_i$$$.",
