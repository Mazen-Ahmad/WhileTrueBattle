  "statement": "You are given an even integer $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$. Your task is to construct a matrix of size $$$n \\times n$$$ consisting of numbers $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ in such a way that the following conditions are true, or report that it is impossible: the sum of all the numbers in the matrix is exactly $$$k$$$; the bitwise $$$\\texttt{XOR}$$$ of all the numbers in the row $$$i$$$ is the same for each $$$i$$$; the bitwise $$$\\texttt{XOR}$$$ of all the numbers in the column $$$j$$$ is the same for each $$$j$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 130$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. Each test case is described by a single line, which contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$, $$$n$$$ is even, $$$0 \\leq k \\leq n^2$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$ if it's possible to construct a matrix that satisfies all of the problem's conditions, and $$$\\texttt{No}$$$ otherwise. If it is possible to construct a matrix, the $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines should contain $$$n$$$ integers representing the elements in the $$$i$$$-th row of the matrix.",
