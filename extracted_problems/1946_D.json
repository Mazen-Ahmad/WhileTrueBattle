  "statement": "Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a favorite number $$$x$$$, so Mark wants to find the maximum number $$$k$$$ such that it is possible to select pairs of numbers [$$$l_1, r_1$$$], [$$$l_2, r_2$$$], $$$\\ldots$$$ [$$$l_k, r_k$$$], such that: $$$l_1 = 1$$$. $$$r_k = n$$$. $$$l_i \\le r_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$. $$$r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k - 1$$$. $$$(a_{l_1} \\oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \\oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus a_{r_2}) | \\ldots | (a_{l_k} \\oplus a_{l_k + 1} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus a_{r_k}) \\le x$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the operation of bitwise XOR , and $$$|$$$ denotes the operation of bitwise OR . If such $$$k$$$ does not exist, then output $$$-1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5, 0 \\le x < 2^{30}$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number $$$x$$$ respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < 2^{30}$$$) — the array $$$a$$$ itself. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum suitable number $$$k$$$, and $$$-1$$$ if such $$$k$$$ does not exist.",
