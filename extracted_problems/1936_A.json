  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. There is a secret sequence $$$p_0, p_1, \\ldots, p_{n-1}$$$, which is a permutation of $$$\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\}$$$. You need to find any two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$p_i \\oplus p_j$$$ is maximized, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation . To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, and $$$d$$$ ($$$0 \\le a,b,c,d < n$$$). Next, the jury calculates $$$x = (p_a \\mid p_b)$$$ and $$$y = (p_c \\mid p_d)$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation . Finally, you receive the result of comparison between $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. In other words, you are told if $$$x < y$$$, $$$x > y$$$, or $$$x = y$$$. Please find any two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$0 \\le i,j < n$$$) such that $$$p_i \\oplus p_j$$$ is maximum among all such pairs, using at most $$$3n$$$ queries. If there are multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of them.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.",
