  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The cost of a segment $$$[l, r]$$$, $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, is defined as $$$|b_l - a_r| + |b_r - a_l|$$$. Recall that two segments $$$[l_1, r_1]$$$, $$$1 \\le l_1 \\le r_1 \\le n$$$, and $$$[l_2, r_2]$$$, $$$1 \\le l_2 \\le r_2 \\le n$$$, are non-intersecting if one of the following conditions is satisfied: $$$r_1 < l_2$$$ or $$$r_2 < l_1$$$. The length of a segment $$$[l, r]$$$, $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, is defined as $$$r - l + 1$$$. Find the maximum possible sum of costs of non-intersecting segments $$$[l_j, r_j]$$$, $$$1 \\le l_j \\le r_j \\le n$$$, whose total length is equal to $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\le t \\le 1000)$$$ — the number of sets of input data. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 3000$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$ and the total length of segments. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test case does not exceed $$$3000$$$.",
