  "statement": "Vlad remembered that he had a series of $$$n$$$ tiles and a number $$$k$$$. The tiles were numbered from left to right, and the $$$i$$$-th tile had colour $$$c_i$$$. If you stand on the first tile and start jumping any number of tiles right , you can get a path of length $$$p$$$. The length of the path is the number of tiles you stood on. Vlad wants to see if it is possible to get a path of length $$$p$$$ such that: it ends at tile with index $$$n$$$; $$$p$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$ the path is divided into blocks of length exactly $$$k$$$ each; tiles in each block have the same colour, the colors in adjacent blocks are not necessarily different. For example, let $$$n = 14$$$, $$$k = 3$$$. The colours of the tiles are contained in the array $$$c$$$ = [$$$\\color{red}{1}, \\color{violet}{2}, \\color{red}{1}, \\color{red}{1}, \\color{gray}{7}, \\color{orange}{5}, \\color{green}{3}, \\color{green}{3}, \\color{red}{1}, \\color{green}{3}, \\color{blue}{4}, \\color{blue}{4}, \\color{violet}{2}, \\color{blue}{4}$$$]. Then we can construct a path of length $$$6$$$ consisting of $$$2$$$ blocks: $$$\\color{red}{c_1} \\rightarrow \\color{red}{c_3} \\rightarrow \\color{red}{c_4} \\rightarrow \\color{blue}{c_{11}} \\rightarrow \\color{blue}{c_{12}} \\rightarrow \\color{blue}{c_{14}}$$$ All tiles from the $$$1$$$-st block will have colour $$$\\color{red}{\\textbf{1}}$$$, from the $$$2$$$-nd block will have colour $$$\\color{blue}{\\textbf{4}}$$$. It is also possible to construct a path of length $$$9$$$ in this example, in which all tiles from the $$$1$$$-st block will have colour $$$\\color{red}{\\textbf{1}}$$$, from the $$$2$$$-nd block will have colour $$$\\color{green}{\\textbf{3}}$$$, and from the $$$3$$$-rd block will have colour $$$\\color{blue}{\\textbf{4}}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)—the number of tiles in the series and the length of the block. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, c_3, \\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le n$$$) — the colours of the tiles. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output on a separate line: YES if you can get a path that satisfies these conditions; NO otherwise. You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will be recognized as positive response).",
