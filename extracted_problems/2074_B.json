  "statement": "The pink soldiers have given you a sequence $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You must repeatedly perform the following operation until there is only $$$1$$$ element left . Choose two distinct indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$. Then, choose a positive integer value $$$x$$$ such that there exists a non-degenerate triangle $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ with side lengths $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_j$$$, and $$$x$$$. Finally, remove two elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$, and append $$$x$$$ to the end of $$$a$$$. Please find the maximum possible value of the only last element in the sequence $$$a$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A triangle with side lengths $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ is non-degenerate when $$$a+b > c$$$, $$$a+c > b$$$, $$$b+c > a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum possible value of the only last element on a separate line.",
