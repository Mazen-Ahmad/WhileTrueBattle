  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ boxes placed in a line. The boxes are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Some boxes contain one ball inside of them, the rest are empty. At least one box contains a ball and at least one box is empty. In one move, you have to choose a box with a ball inside and an adjacent empty box and move the ball from one box into another. Boxes $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ are considered adjacent to each other. Boxes $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ are not adjacent . How many different arrangements of balls exist after exactly $$$k$$$ moves are performed? Two arrangements are considered different if there is at least one such box that it contains a ball in one of them and doesn't contain a ball in the other one. Since the answer might be pretty large, print its remainder modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 1500$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 1500$$$) — the number of boxes and the number of moves. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$$$) — $$$0$$$ denotes an empty box and $$$1$$$ denotes a box with a ball inside. There is at least one $$$0$$$ and at least one $$$1$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer — the number of different arrangements of balls that can exist after exactly $$$k$$$ moves are performed, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
