  "statement": "Paprika loves permutations. She has an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. She wants to make the array a permutation of integers $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. In order to achieve this goal, she can perform operations on the array. In each operation she can choose two integers $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) and $$$x$$$ ($$$x > 0$$$), then perform $$$a_i := a_i \\bmod x$$$ (that is, replace $$$a_i$$$ by the remainder of $$$a_i$$$ divided by $$$x$$$). In different operations, the chosen $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ can be different . Determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the array a permutation of integers $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. If it is impossible, output $$$-1$$$. A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum number of operations needed to make the array a permutation of integers $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.",
