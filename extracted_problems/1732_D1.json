  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version there are no \"remove\" queries. Initially you have a set containing one element — $$$0$$$. You need to handle $$$q$$$ queries of the following types: + $$$x$$$ — add the integer $$$x$$$ to the set. It is guaranteed that this integer is not contained in the set; ? $$$k$$$ — find the $$$k\\text{-mex}$$$ of the set. In our problem, we define the $$$k\\text{-mex}$$$ of a set of integers as the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ that is divisible by $$$k$$$ and which is not contained in the set.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. The following $$$q$$$ lines describe the queries. An addition query of integer $$$x$$$ is given in the format + $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq 10^{18}$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$x$$$ was not contained in the set. A search query of $$$k\\text{-mex}$$$ is given in the format ? $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^{18}$$$). It is guaranteed that there will be at least one query of type ? .",
  "outputFormat": "For each query of type ? output a single integer — the $$$k\\text{-mex}$$$ of the set.",
