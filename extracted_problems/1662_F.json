  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ equidistant antennas on a line, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each antenna has a power rating, the power of the $$$i$$$-th antenna is $$$p_i$$$. The $$$i$$$-th and the $$$j$$$-th antenna can communicate directly if and only if their distance is at most the minimum of their powers, i.e., $$$|i-j| \\leq \\min(p_i, p_j)$$$. Sending a message directly between two such antennas takes $$$1$$$ second. What is the minimum amount of time necessary to send a message from antenna $$$a$$$ to antenna $$$b$$$, possibly using other antennas as relays?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 100\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n \\leq 200\\,000$$$) — the number of antennas, and the origin and target antenna. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$) — the powers of the antennas. The sum of the values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$200\\,000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the number of seconds needed to trasmit a message from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$. It can be shown that under the problem constraints, it is always possible to send such a message.",
