  "statement": "You are given a square grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. Each cell contains either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. In an operation, you can select a cell of the grid and flip it (from $$$0 \\to 1$$$ or $$$1 \\to 0$$$). Find the minimum number of operations you need to obtain a square that remains the same when rotated $$$0^{\\circ}$$$, $$$90^{\\circ}$$$, $$$180^{\\circ}$$$ and $$$270^{\\circ}$$$. The picture below shows an example of all rotations of a grid.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the size of the grid. Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, each with $$$n$$$ characters $$$a_{i,j}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_{i,j} \\leq 1$$$) — the number written in each cell.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make the square look the same rotated $$$0^{\\circ}$$$, $$$90^{\\circ}$$$, $$$180^{\\circ}$$$ and $$$270^{\\circ}$$$.",
