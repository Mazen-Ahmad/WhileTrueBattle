  "statement": "Rishi is developing games in the 2D metaverse and wants to offer game bundles to his customers. Each game has an associated enjoyment value. A game bundle consists of a subset of games whose total enjoyment value adds up to $$$60$$$. Your task is to choose $$$k$$$ games, where $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 60$$$, along with their respective enjoyment values $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$, in such a way that exactly $$$m$$$ distinct game bundles can be formed.",
  "inputFormat": "The input is a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 10^{10}$$$) — the desired number of game bundles.",
  "outputFormat": "The first line should contain an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le 60$$$) — the number of games. The second line should contain $$$k$$$ integers, $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k \\le 60$$$) — the enjoyment values of the $$$k$$$ games.",
