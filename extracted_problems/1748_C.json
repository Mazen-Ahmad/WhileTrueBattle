  "statement": "The score of an array $$$v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_n$$$ is defined as the number of indices $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) such that $$$v_1+v_2+\\ldots+v_i = 0$$$. You are given an array $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation multiple times: select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) such that $$$a_i=0$$$; then replace $$$a_i$$$ by an arbitrary integer. What is the maximum possible score of $$$a$$$ that can be obtained by performing a sequence of such operations?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
