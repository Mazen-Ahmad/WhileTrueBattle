  "statement": "You are given an array of integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_n$$$ and an integer $$$d$$$. Is it possible to construct a tree satisfying the following three conditions? The tree contains $$$n + 1$$$ nodes. The length of the $$$i$$$-th edge is equal to $$$l_i$$$. The (weighted) diameter of the tree is equal to $$$d$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 250$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$d$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2000, 1 \\leq d \\leq 2000$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq d$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$ if it is possible to construct a tree that satisfies all the conditions, and $$$\\texttt{No}$$$ otherwise. You can print the letters in any case (upper or lower).",
