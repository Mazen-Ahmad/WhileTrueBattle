  "statement": "The only difference between the two versions is that in this version $$$n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ . A terminal is a row of $$$n$$$ equal segments numbered $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in order. There are two terminals, one above the other. You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. For all $$$i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$$$, there should be a straight wire from some point on segment $$$i$$$ of the top terminal to some point on segment $$$a_i$$$ of the bottom terminal. You can't select the endpoints of a segment. For example, the following pictures show two possible wirings if $$$n=7$$$ and $$$a=[4,1,4,6,7,7,5]$$$. A crossing occurs when two wires share a point in common. In the picture above, crossings are circled in red. What is the maximum number of crossings there can be if you place the wires optimally?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array. The sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of crossings there can be if you place the wires optimally.",
