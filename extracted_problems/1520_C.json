  "statement": "We will consider the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ as adjacent if they differ by exactly one, that is, $$$|a-b|=1$$$. We will consider cells of a square matrix $$$n \\times n$$$ as adjacent if they have a common side, that is, for cell $$$(r, c)$$$ cells $$$(r, c-1)$$$, $$$(r, c+1)$$$, $$$(r-1, c)$$$ and $$$(r+1, c)$$$ are adjacent to it. For a given number $$$n$$$, construct a square matrix $$$n \\times n$$$ such that: Each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n^2$$$ occurs in this matrix exactly once; If $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ and $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$ are adjacent cells, then the numbers written in them must not be adjacent .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case is characterized by one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output: -1 , if the required matrix does not exist; the required matrix, otherwise (any such matrix if many of them exist). The matrix should be outputted as $$$n$$$ lines, where each line contains $$$n$$$ integers.",
