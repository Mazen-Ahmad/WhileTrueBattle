  "statement": "Flower gives Gellyfish two permutations$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$[0, 1, \\ldots, n-1]$$$: $$$p_0, p_1, \\ldots, p_{n-1}$$$ and $$$q_0, q_1, \\ldots, q_{n-1}$$$. Now Gellyfish wants to calculate an array $$$r_0,r_1,\\ldots,r_{n-1}$$$ through the following method: For all $$$i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$$$), $$$r_i = \\max\\limits_{j=0}^{i} \\left(2^{p_j} + 2^{q_{i-j}} \\right)$$$ But since Gellyfish is very lazy, you have to help her figure out the elements of $$$r$$$. Since the elements of $$$r$$$ are very large, you are only required to output the elements of $$$r$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$b$$$ is a permutation of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ consists of the elements of $$$a$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[4,2,3,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$[3,2,4,4]$$$ while $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation of $$$[1,2,3]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_0, p_1, \\ldots,p_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq p_i < n$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$q_0, q_1, \\ldots,q_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq q_i < n$$$). It is guaranteed that both $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are permutations of $$$[0, 1, \\ldots, n-1]$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_0, r_1, \\ldots, r_{n-1}$$$ in a single line, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
