  "statement": "Bodya and Sasha found a permutation $$$p_1,\\dots,p_n$$$ and an array $$$a_1,\\dots,a_n$$$. They decided to play a well-known \"Permutation game\". A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation. The game lasts $$$k$$$ turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn, two things happen to each player: If the current position of the player is $$$x$$$, his score increases by $$$a_x$$$. Then the player either stays at his current position $$$x$$$ or moves from $$$x$$$ to $$$p_x$$$. The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly $$$k$$$ turns. Knowing Bodya's starting position $$$P_B$$$ and Sasha's starting position $$$P_S$$$, determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$P_B$$$, $$$P_S$$$ ($$$1\\le P_B,P_S\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\le k\\le 10^9$$$) — length of the permutation, duration of the game, starting positions respectively. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,\\dots,p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) — elements of the permutation $$$p$$$. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le 10^9$$$) — elements of array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase output: \" Bodya \" if Bodya wins the game. \" Sasha \" if Sasha wins the game. \" Draw \" if the players have the same score.",
