  "statement": "You are given an array of exactly $$$n$$$ numbers $$$[1,2,3,\\ldots,n]$$$ along with integers $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$. Partition the array in exactly $$$k$$$ non-empty disjoint subsequences such that the bitwise XOR of all numbers in each subsequence is $$$x$$$, and each number is in exactly one subsequence. Notice that there are no constraints on the length of each subsequence. A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. For example, for $$$n = 15$$$, $$$k = 6$$$, $$$x = 7$$$, the following scheme is valid: $$$[6,10,11]$$$, $$$6 \\oplus 10 \\oplus 11 = 7$$$, $$$[5,12,14]$$$, $$$5 \\oplus 12 \\oplus 14 = 7$$$, $$$[3,9,13]$$$, $$$3 \\oplus 9 \\oplus 13 = 7$$$, $$$[1,2,4]$$$, $$$1 \\oplus 2 \\oplus 4 = 7$$$, $$$[8,15]$$$, $$$8 \\oplus 15 = 7$$$, $$$[7]$$$, $$$7 = 7$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ represents the bitwise XOR operation. The following scheme is invalid, since $$$8$$$, $$$15$$$ do not appear: $$$[6,10,11]$$$, $$$6 \\oplus 10 \\oplus 11 = 7$$$, $$$[5,12,14]$$$, $$$5 \\oplus 12 \\oplus 14 = 7$$$, $$$[3,9,13]$$$, $$$3 \\oplus 9 \\oplus 13 = 7$$$, $$$[1,2,4]$$$, $$$1 \\oplus 2 \\oplus 4 = 7$$$, $$$[7]$$$, $$$7 = 7$$$. The following scheme is invalid, since $$$3$$$ appears twice, and $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ do not appear: $$$[6,10,11]$$$, $$$6 \\oplus 10 \\oplus 11 = 7$$$, $$$[5,12,14]$$$, $$$5 \\oplus 12 \\oplus 14 = 7$$$, $$$[3,9,13]$$$, $$$3 \\oplus 9 \\oplus 13 = 7$$$, $$$[3,4]$$$, $$$3 \\oplus 4 = 7$$$, $$$[8,15]$$$, $$$8 \\oplus 15 = 7$$$, $$$[7]$$$, $$$7 = 7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first and the only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1\\le x \\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array, the number of subsequences and the required XOR. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is possible to partition the sequence, print \" YES \" in the first line. In the $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$k$$$ lines first print the length $$$s_i$$$ of the $$$i$$$-th subsequence, then print $$$s_i$$$ integers, representing the elements in the $$$i$$$-th subsequence. If there are multiple answers, print any. Note that you can print a subsequence in any order. If it is not possible to partition the sequence, print \" NO \".",
