  "statement": "Let's call a positive integer extremely round if it has only one non-zero digit. For example, $$$5000$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$10$$$, $$$200$$$ are extremely round integers; $$$42$$$, $$$13$$$, $$$666$$$, $$$77$$$, $$$101$$$ are not. You are given an integer $$$n$$$. You have to calculate the number of extremely round integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\le x \\le n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then, $$$t$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 999999$$$) — the description of the $$$i$$$-th test case.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the number of extremely round integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\le x \\le n$$$.",
