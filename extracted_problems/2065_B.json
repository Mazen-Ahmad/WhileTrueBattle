  "statement": "Skibidus is given a string $$$s$$$ that consists of lowercase Latin letters. If $$$s$$$ contains more than $$$1$$$ letter, he can: Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq |s| - 1$$$, $$$|s|$$$ denotes the current length of $$$s$$$) such that $$$s_i = s_{i+1}$$$. Replace $$$s_i$$$ with any lowercase Latin letter of his choice. Remove $$$s_{i+1}$$$ from the string. Skibidus must determine the minimum possible length he can achieve through any number of operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq |s| \\leq 100$$$). It is guaranteed $$$s$$$ only contains lowercase Latin letters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output an integer on the new line, the minimum achievable length of $$$s$$$.",
