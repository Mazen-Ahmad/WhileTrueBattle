  "statement": "Baltic, a famous chess player who is also a mathematician, has an array $$$a_1,a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, and he can perform the following operation several (possibly $$$0$$$) times: Choose some index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$); multiply $$$a_i$$$ with $$$-1$$$, that is, set $$$a_i := -a_i$$$. Baltic's favorite number is $$$m$$$, and he wants $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_m$$$ to be the smallest of all non-empty prefix sums. More formally, for each $$$k = 1,2,\\ldots, n$$$ it should hold that $$$$$$a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_k \\geq a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_m.$$$$$$ Please note that multiple smallest prefix sums may exist and that it is only required that $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_m$$$ is one of them. Help Baltic find the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_m$$$ the least of all prefix sums. It can be shown that a valid sequence of operations always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10\\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of Baltic's array and his favorite number. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of required operations.",
