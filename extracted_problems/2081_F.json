  "statement": "Piggy Zhou loves matrices, especially those that make him get excited, called hot matrix . A hot matrix of size $$$n \\times n$$$ can be defined as follows. Let $$$a_{i, j}$$$ denote the element in the $$$i$$$-th row, $$$j$$$-th column ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$). Each column and row of the matrix is a permutation of all numbers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. For each pair of indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, such that $$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, $$$a_{i, j} + a_{i, n - j + 1} = n - 1$$$. For each pair of indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, such that $$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, $$$a_{i, j} + a_{n - i + 1, j} = n - 1$$$. All ordered pairs $$$\\left(a_{i, j}, a_{i, j + 1}\\right)$$$, where $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le j < n$$$, are distinct. All ordered pairs $$$\\left(a_{i, j}, a_{i + 1, j}\\right)$$$, where $$$1 \\le i < n$$$, $$$1 \\le j \\le n$$$, are distinct. Now, Piggy Zhou gives you a number $$$n$$$, and you need to provide him with a hot matrix if the hot matrix exists for the given $$$n$$$, or inform him that he will never get excited if the hot matrix does not exist for the given $$$n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3000$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$3000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" NO \" (without quotes) if the hot matrix does not exist for the given $$$n$$$. Otherwise, print \" YES \" (without quotes) on the first line. Then output $$$n$$$ rows, with $$$n$$$ numbers in each row, representing the hot matrix of size $$$n\\times n$$$ that meets the requirements of the problem. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
