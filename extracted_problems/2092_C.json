  "statement": "For her birthday, each of Asuna's $$$n$$$ admirers gifted her a tower. The height of the tower from the $$$i$$$-th admirer is equal to $$$a_i$$$. Asuna evaluates the beauty of the received gifts as $$$\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$$$. She can perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero). Take such $$$1 \\le i \\neq j \\le n$$$ that $$$a_i + a_j$$$ is odd and $$$a_i > 0$$$, then decrease $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$ and increase $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$. It is easy to see that the heights of the towers remain non-negative during the operations. Help Asuna find the maximum possible beauty of the gifts after any number of operations!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line of the input data contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of admirers of Asuna. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\ (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9)$$$ — the heights of the towers. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum value of the beauty of the gifts that Asuna can achieve.",
