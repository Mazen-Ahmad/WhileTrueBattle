  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ points $$$1,2,\\ldots,n$$$, each point $$$i$$$ has a number $$$a_i$$$ on it. You're playing a game on them. Initially, you are at point $$$1$$$. When you are at point $$$i$$$, take following steps: If $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$, go to $$$i+a_i$$$, Otherwise, the game ends. Before the game begins, you can choose two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ satisfying $$$1\\le x\\le n$$$, $$$-n \\le y \\le n$$$ and replace $$$a_x$$$ with $$$y$$$ (set $$$a_x := y$$$). Find the number of distinct pairs $$$(x,y)$$$ such that the game that you start after making the change ends in a finite number of steps. Notice that you do not have to satisfy $$$a_x\\not=y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4)$$$ — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of points. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-n \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the numbers on the axis. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a line containing a single integer — the number of distinct pairs $$$(x,y)$$$ with which the game ends.",
