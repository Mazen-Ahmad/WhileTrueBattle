  "statement": "An integer array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is said to be a PalindORme if ($$$a_{1}$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$a_{2} $$$ $$$|$$$ $$$ \\ldots $$$ $$$|$$$ $$$ a_{i}) = (a_{{n - i + 1}} $$$ $$$|$$$ $$$ \\ldots $$$ $$$|$$$ $$$ a_{{n - 1}} $$$ $$$|$$$ $$$ a_{n}) $$$ for all $$$ 1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation . An integer array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is considered to be good if its elements can be rearranged to form a PalindORme. Formally, array $$$a$$$ is good if there exists a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots p_n$$$ (an array where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once) for which $$$a_{p_1}, a_{p_2}, \\ldots a_{p_n}$$$ is a PalindORme. Find the number of good arrays of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of integers in the range $$$[0, 2^{k} - 1]$$$, and print it modulo some prime $$$m$$$. Two arrays $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ are considered to be different if there exists any $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$$$ such that $$$a_i \\ne b_i$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first and only line of the input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,k \\leq 80$$$, $$$10^8 \\lt m \\lt 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$m$$$ is prime.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer â€” the number of good arrays modulo $$$m$$$.",
