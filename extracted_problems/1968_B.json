  "statement": "You are given two binary strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. A binary string is a string consisting of the characters ' 0 ' and ' 1 '. Your task is to determine the maximum possible number $$$k$$$ such that a prefix of string $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ is a subsequence of string $$$b$$$. A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line consists of a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\le n,m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of string $$$a$$$ and the length of string $$$b$$$, respectively. The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The third line of each test case contains a binary string $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. Similarly, the sum of values $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single number — the maximum $$$k$$$, such that the first $$$k$$$ characters of $$$a$$$ form a subsequence of $$$b$$$.",
