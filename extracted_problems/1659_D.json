  "statement": "Suppose you had an array $$$A$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements, each of which is $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. Let us define a function $$$f(k,A)$$$ which returns another array $$$B$$$, the result of sorting the first $$$k$$$ elements of $$$A$$$ in non-decreasing order. For example, $$$f(4,[0,1,1,0,0,1,0]) = [0,0,1,1,0,1,0]$$$. Note that the first $$$4$$$ elements were sorted. Now consider the arrays $$$B_1, B_2,\\ldots, B_n$$$ generated by $$$f(1,A), f(2,A),\\ldots,f(n,A)$$$. Let $$$C$$$ be the array obtained by taking the element-wise sum of $$$B_1, B_2,\\ldots, B_n$$$. For example, let $$$A=[0,1,0,1]$$$. Then we have $$$B_1=[0,1,0,1]$$$, $$$B_2=[0,1,0,1]$$$, $$$B_3=[0,0,1,1]$$$, $$$B_4=[0,0,1,1]$$$. Then $$$C=B_1+B_2+B_3+B_4=[0,1,0,1]+[0,1,0,1]+[0,0,1,1]+[0,0,1,1]=[0,2,2,4]$$$. You are given $$$C$$$. Determine a binary array $$$A$$$ that would give $$$C$$$ when processed as above. It is guaranteed that an array $$$A$$$ exists for given $$$C$$$ in the input.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case has two lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq c_i \\leq n$$$). It is guaranteed that a valid array $$$A$$$ exists for the given $$$C$$$. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i$$$ is $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$). If there are multiple answers, you may output any of them.",
