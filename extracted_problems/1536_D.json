  "statement": "Uh oh! Ray lost his array yet again! However, Omkar might be able to help because he thinks he has found the OmkArray of Ray's array. The OmkArray of an array $$$a$$$ with elements $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2k-1}$$$, is the array $$$b$$$ with elements $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{k}$$$ such that $$$b_i$$$ is equal to the median of $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2i-1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$. Omkar has found an array $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$-10^9 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$). Given this array $$$b$$$, Ray wants to test Omkar's claim and see if $$$b$$$ actually is an OmkArray of some array $$$a$$$. Can you help Ray? The median of a set of numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2i-1}$$$ is the number $$$c_{i}$$$ where $$$c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots, c_{2i-1}$$$ represents $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2i-1}$$$ sorted in nondecreasing order.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$b$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one line containing YES if there exists an array $$$a$$$ such that $$$b_i$$$ is the median of $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{2i-1}$$$ for all $$$i$$$, and NO otherwise. The case of letters in YES and NO do not matter (so yEs and No will also be accepted).",
