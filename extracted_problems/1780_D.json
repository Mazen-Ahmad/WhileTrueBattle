  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. Kira has a hidden positive integer $$$n$$$, and Hayato needs to guess it. Initially, Kira gives Hayato the value $$$\\mathrm{cnt}$$$ — the number of unit bits in the binary notation of $$$n$$$. To guess $$$n$$$, Hayato can only do operations of one kind: choose an integer $$$x$$$ and subtract it from $$$n$$$. Note that after each operation, the number $$$n$$$ changes . Kira doesn't like bad requests, so if Hayato tries to subtract a number $$$x$$$ greater than $$$n$$$, he will lose to Kira. After each operation, Kira gives Hayato the updated value $$$\\mathrm{cnt}$$$ — the number of unit bits in the binary notation of the updated value of $$$n$$$. Kira doesn't have much patience, so Hayato must guess the original value of $$$n$$$ after no more than $$$30$$$ operations. Since Hayato is in elementary school, he asks for your help. Write a program that guesses the number $$$n$$$. Kira is an honest person, so he chooses the initial number $$$n$$$ before all operations and does not change it afterward.",
  "inputFormat": "The input data contains several test cases. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains the number $$$\\mathrm{cnt}$$$ — the initial number of unit bits in the binary notation $$$n$$$. The hidden integer $$$n$$$ satisfies the following constraint: $$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$.",
