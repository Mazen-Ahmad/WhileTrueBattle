  "statement": "You have $$$n$$$ sticks, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The length of the $$$i$$$-th stick is $$$2^{a_i}$$$. You want to choose exactly $$$3$$$ sticks out of the given $$$n$$$ sticks, and form a non-degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater than $$$0$$$. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly $$$3$$$ sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks does not matter (for example, choosing the $$$1$$$-st, $$$2$$$-nd and $$$4$$$-th stick is the same as choosing the $$$2$$$-nd, $$$4$$$-th and $$$1$$$-st stick).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$); the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly $$$3$$$ sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.",
