  "statement": "You are given two strongly connected$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ directed graphs, each with exactly $$$n$$$ vertices, but possibly different numbers of edges. Upon closer inspection, you noticed an important feature — the length of any cycle in these graphs is divisible by $$$k$$$. Each of the $$$2n$$$ vertices belongs to exactly one of two types: incoming or outgoing . For each vertex, its type is known to you. You need to determine whether it is possible to draw exactly $$$n$$$ directed edges between the source graphs such that the following four conditions are met: The ends of any added edge lie in different graphs. From each outgoing vertex, exactly one added edge originates. Into each incoming vertex, exactly one added edge enters. In the resulting graph, the length of any cycle is divisible by $$$k$$$. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$A strongly connected graph is a graph in which there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in each graph and the value by which the length of each cycle is divisible. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$$$). If $$$a_i = 0$$$, then vertex $$$i$$$ of the first graph is incoming. If $$$a_i = 1$$$, then vertex $$$i$$$ of the first graph is outgoing. The third line of each test case contains a single integer $$$m_1$$$ ($$$1 \\le m_1 \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of edges in the first graph. The next $$$m_1$$$ lines contain descriptions of the edges of the first graph. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n$$$) — an edge in the first graph leading from vertex $$$v_i$$$ to vertex $$$u_i$$$. Next, in the same format, follows the description of the second graph. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$b_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$$$). If $$$b_i = 0$$$, then vertex $$$i$$$ of the second graph is incoming. If $$$b_i = 1$$$, then vertex $$$i$$$ of the second graph is outgoing. The next line contains a single integer $$$m_2$$$ ($$$1 \\le m_2 \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of edges in the second graph. The next $$$m_2$$$ lines contain descriptions of the edges of the second graph. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n$$$) — an edge in the second graph leading from vertex $$$v_i$$$ to vertex $$$u_i$$$. It is guaranteed that both graphs are strongly connected, and the lengths of all cycles are divisible by $$$k$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m_1$$$ and the sum of $$$m_2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output \" YES \" (without quotes) if it is possible to draw $$$n$$$ new edges such that all conditions are met, and \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \", and \" YES \" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
