  "statement": "Petya has an array $$$a_i$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. His brother Vasya became envious and decided to make his own array of $$$n$$$ integers. To do this, he found $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_i$$$ ($$$m\\ge n$$$), and now he wants to choose some $$$n$$$ integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array $$$c_i$$$ of length $$$n$$$. To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total difference $$$D = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|$$$ to be as large as possible. Help Vasya find the maximum difference $$$D$$$ he can obtain.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le m\\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le 10^9$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1\\le b_i\\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference $$$D$$$ that can be obtained.",
