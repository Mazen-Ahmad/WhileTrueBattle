  "statement": "Three guys play a game: first, each person writes down $$$n$$$ distinct words of length $$$3$$$. Then, they total up the number of points as follows: if a word was written by one person — that person gets 3 points, if a word was written by two people — each of the two gets 1 point, if a word was written by all — nobody gets any points. In the end, how many points does each player have?",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of words written by each person. The following three lines each contain $$$n$$$ distinct strings — the words written by each person. Each string consists of $$$3$$$ lowercase English characters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output three space-separated integers — the number of points each of the three guys earned. You should output the answers in the same order as the input; the $$$i$$$-th integer should be the number of points earned by the $$$i$$$-th guy.",
