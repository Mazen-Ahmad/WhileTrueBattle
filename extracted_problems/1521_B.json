  "statement": "Nastia has received an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers as a gift . She calls such an array $$$a$$$ good that for all $$$i$$$ ($$$2 \\le i \\le n$$$) takes place $$$gcd(a_{i - 1}, a_{i}) = 1$$$, where $$$gcd(u, v)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. You can perform the operation: select two different indices $$$i, j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, $$$i \\neq j$$$) and two integers $$$x, y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$$$) so that $$$\\min{(a_i, a_j)} = \\min{(x, y)}$$$. Then change $$$a_i$$$ to $$$x$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ to $$$y$$$. The girl asks you to make the array good using at most $$$n$$$ operations. It can be proven that this is always possible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array which Nastia has received as a gift. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ in one test doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each of $$$t$$$ test cases print a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$) — the number of operations. You don't need to minimize this number. In each of the next $$$k$$$ lines print $$$4$$$ integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\neq j \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le x, y \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$$$) so that $$$\\min{(a_i, a_j)} = \\min{(x, y)}$$$ — in this manner you replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$x$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ with $$$y$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any.",
