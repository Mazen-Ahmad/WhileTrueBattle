  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 50$$$) â€” the number of test cases in the test. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single integer number $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le 50$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$t$$$ answers to the test cases: if a positive integer number with the sum of digits equal to $$$x$$$ and all digits are different exists, print the smallest such number; otherwise print -1 .",
