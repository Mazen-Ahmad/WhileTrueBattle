  "statement": "Reve has two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Let $$$p$$$ be a permutation$$$^\\dagger$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Let $$$c$$$ be an array of length $$$n - k + 1$$$ such that $$$$$$c_i = \\max(p_i, \\dots, p_{i+k-1}) + \\min(p_i, \\dots, p_{i+k-1}).$$$$$$ Let the cost of the permutation $$$p$$$ be the maximum element of $$$c$$$. Koxia wants you to construct a permutation with the minimum possible cost. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_n$$$, which is a permutation with minimal cost. If there is more than one permutation with minimal cost, you may output any of them.",
