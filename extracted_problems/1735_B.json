  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ pieces of tangerine peel, the $$$i$$$-th of them has size $$$a_i$$$. In one step it is possible to divide one piece of size $$$x$$$ into two pieces of positive integer sizes $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$ so that $$$y + z = x$$$. You want that for each pair of pieces, their sizes differ strictly less than twice. In other words, there should not be two pieces of size $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, such that $$$2x \\le y$$$. What is the minimum possible number of steps needed to satisfy the condition?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$). Then one line follows, containing $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\ldots \\le a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^7$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of steps.",
