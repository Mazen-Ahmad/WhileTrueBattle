  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. In one operation, you must pick some $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1\\leq i < j\\leq |a|$$$ and append $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$ to the end of the $$$a$$$ (i.e. increase $$$n$$$ by $$$1$$$ and set $$$a_n$$$ to $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$). Your task is to minimize and print the minimum value of $$$a$$$ after performing $$$k$$$ operations.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^3$$$, $$$1\\le k\\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the number of operations you should perform. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le 10^{18}$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the smallest possible value of the minimum of array $$$a$$$ after performing $$$k$$$ operations.",
