  "statement": "On March 14, the day of the number $$$\\pi$$$ is celebrated all over the world. This is a very important mathematical constant equal to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Polycarp was told at school that the number $$$\\pi$$$ is irrational, therefore it has an infinite number of digits in decimal notation. He wanted to prepare for the Day of the number $$$\\pi$$$ by memorizing this number as accurately as possible. Polycarp wrote out all the digits that he managed to remember. For example, if Polycarp remembered $$$\\pi$$$ as $$$3.1415$$$, he wrote out 31415 . Polycarp was in a hurry and could have made a mistake, so you decided to check how many first digits of the number $$$\\pi$$$ Polycarp actually remembers correctly.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input data contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) â€” the number of test cases in the test. Each test case is described by a single string of digits $$$n$$$, which was written out by Polycarp. The string $$$n$$$ contains up to $$$30$$$ digits.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$t$$$ integers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case, that is how many first digits of the number $$$\\pi$$$ Polycarp remembers correctly.",
