  "statement": "This is an easy version of this problem. The differences between the versions are the constraint on $$$m$$$ and $$$r_i < l_{i + 1}$$$ holds for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m - 1$$$ in the easy version. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. Turtle gives you $$$m$$$ intervals $$$[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\ldots, [l_m, r_m]$$$. He thinks that a permutation $$$p$$$ is interesting if there exists an integer $$$k_i$$$ for every interval ($$$l_i \\le k_i < r_i$$$), and if he lets $$$a_i = \\max\\limits_{j = l_i}^{k_i} p_j, b_i = \\min\\limits_{j = k_i + 1}^{r_i} p_j$$$ for every integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, the following condition holds: $$$$$$\\max\\limits_{i = 1}^m a_i < \\min\\limits_{i = 1}^m b_i$$$$$$ Turtle wants you to calculate the maximum number of inversions of all interesting permutations of length $$$n$$$, or tell him if there is no interesting permutation. An inversion of a permutation $$$p$$$ is a pair of integers $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$) such that $$$p_i > p_j$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^3, 0 \\le m \\le \\frac{n}{2}$$$) — the length of the permutation and the number of intervals. The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i < r_i \\le n$$$) — the $$$i$$$-th interval. Additional constraint on the input in this version: $$$r_i < l_{i + 1}$$$ holds for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m - 1$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^3$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no interesting permutation, output a single integer $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output a single integer — the maximum number of inversions.",
