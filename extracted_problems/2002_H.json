  "statement": "It's been a long summer's day, with the constant chirping of cicadas and the heat which never seemed to end. Finally, it has drawn to a close. The showdown has passed, the gates are open, and only a gentle breeze is left behind. Your predecessors had taken their final bow; it's your turn to take the stage. Sorting through some notes that were left behind, you found a curious statement named Problem 101 : Given a positive integer sequence $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$, you can operate on it any number of times. In an operation, you choose three consecutive elements $$$a_i,a_{i+1},a_{i+2}$$$, and merge them into one element $$$\\max(a_i+1,a_{i+1},a_{i+2}+1)$$$. Please calculate the maximum number of operations you can do without creating an element greater than $$$m$$$. After some thought, you decided to propose the following problem, named Counting 101 : Given $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. For each $$$k=0,1,\\ldots,\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$$, please find the number of integer sequences $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ with elements in $$$[1, m]$$$, such that when used as input for Problem 101 , the answer is $$$k$$$. As the answer can be very large, please print it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 130$$$, $$$1\\le m\\le 30$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$$ numbers. The $$$i$$$-th number is the number of valid sequences such that when used as input for Problem 101 , the answer is $$$i-1$$$, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
