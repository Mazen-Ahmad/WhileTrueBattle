  "statement": "Marin wants you to count number of permutations that are beautiful . A beautiful permutation of length $$$n$$$ is a permutation that has the following property: $$$$$$ \\gcd (1 \\cdot p_1, \\, 2 \\cdot p_2, \\, \\dots, \\, n \\cdot p_n) > 1, $$$$$$ where $$$\\gcd$$$ is the greatest common divisor . A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3, 4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^3$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — number of beautiful permutations. Because the answer can be very big, please print the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
