  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters \" + \" and \" - \". $$$s$$$ represents an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ defined by $$$a_i=1$$$ if $$$s_i=$$$ \" + \" and $$$a_i=-1$$$ if $$$s_i=$$$ \" - \". You will do the following process to calculate your penalty: Split $$$a$$$ into non-empty arrays $$$b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_k$$$ such that $$$b_1+b_2+\\ldots+b_k=a^\\dagger$$$, where $$$+$$$ denotes array concatenation. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array $$$c$$$ of length $$$m$$$, its penalty is calculated as $$$p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\\ldots+c_m| \\cdot m$$$. The total penalty that you will receive is $$$p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\\ldots+p(b_k)$$$. If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty you will receive. $$$^\\dagger$$$ Some valid ways to split $$$a=[3,1,4,1,5]$$$ into $$$(b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_k)$$$ are $$$([3],[1],[4],[1],[5])$$$, $$$([3,1],[4,1,5])$$$ and $$$([3,1,4,1,5])$$$ while some invalid ways to split $$$a$$$ are $$$([3,1],[1,5])$$$, $$$([3],[\\,],[1,4],[1,5])$$$ and $$$([3,4],[5,1,1])$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5000$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains string $$$s$$$ ($$$s_i \\in \\{ \\mathtt{+}, \\mathtt{-} \\}$$$, $$$|s| = n$$$). Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.",
