  "statement": "You are given a sequence of integers. Output the alternating sum of this sequence. In other words, output $$$a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + a_5 - \\dots$$$. That is, the signs of plus and minus alternate, starting with a plus.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the test contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follow $$$t$$$ test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the length of the sequence. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$t$$$ lines. For each test case, output the required alternating sum of the numbers.",
