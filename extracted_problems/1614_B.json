  "statement": "The company \"Divan's Sofas\" is planning to build $$$n + 1$$$ different buildings on a coordinate line so that: the coordinate of each building is an integer number; no two buildings stand at the same point. Let $$$x_i$$$ be the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th building. To get from the building $$$i$$$ to the building $$$j$$$, Divan spends $$$|x_i - x_j|$$$ minutes, where $$$|y|$$$ is the absolute value of $$$y$$$. All buildings that Divan is going to build can be numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$. The businessman will live in the building $$$0$$$, the new headquarters of \"Divan's Sofas\". In the first ten years after construction Divan will visit the $$$i$$$-th building $$$a_i$$$ times, each time spending $$$2 \\cdot |x_0-x_i|$$$ minutes for walking. Divan asks you to choose the coordinates for all $$$n + 1$$$ buildings so that over the next ten years the businessman will spend as little time for walking as possible.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains several test cases. The first line contains one integer number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of buildings that \"Divan's Sofas\" is going to build, apart from the headquarters. The second line contains the sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of visits to the $$$i$$$-th building. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, on the first line print the number $$$T$$$ — the minimum time Divan will spend walking. On the second line print the sequence $$$x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_n$$$ of $$$n + 1$$$ integers, where $$$x_i$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\le x_i \\le 10^6$$$) is the selected coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th building. It can be shown that an optimal answer exists with coordinates not exceeding $$$10^6$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
