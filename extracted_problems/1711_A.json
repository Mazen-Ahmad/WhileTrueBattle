  "statement": "You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. The weight of a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ is the number of indices $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$ such that $$$i$$$ divides $$$p_i$$$. Find a permutation $$$p_1,p_2,\\dots, p_n$$$ with the minimum possible weight (among all permutations of length $$$n$$$). A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the length of permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a line containing $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2,\\dots, p_n$$$ so that the permutation $$$p$$$ has the minimum possible weight. If there are several possible answers, you can print any of them.",
