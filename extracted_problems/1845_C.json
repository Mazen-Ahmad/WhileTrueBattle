  "statement": "Monocarp finally got the courage to register on ForceCoders. He came up with a handle but is still thinking about the password. He wants his password to be as strong as possible, so he came up with the following criteria: the length of the password should be exactly $$$m$$$; the password should only consist of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$; the password should not appear in the password database (given as a string $$$s$$$) as a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous). Monocarp also came up with two strings of length $$$m$$$: $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both consisting only of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$. He wants the $$$i$$$-th digit of his password to be between $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$, inclusive. Does there exist a password that fits all criteria?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$), consisting only of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$ — the password database. The second line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 10$$$) — the required length of the password. The third line contains a string $$$l$$$ ($$$|l| = m$$$), consisting only of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$ — the lower restriction on each digit. The fourth line contains a string $$$r$$$ ($$$|r| = m$$$), consisting only of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$ — the upper restriction on each digit. $$$l_i \\le r_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. The sum of lengths of $$$s$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print \" YES \" if there exists a password that fits all criteria. Print \" NO \" otherwise.",
