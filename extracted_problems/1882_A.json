  "statement": "You are given a sequence $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$$$. A sequence $$$b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$$$ is called good , if it satisfies all of the following conditions: $$$b_{i}$$$ is a positive integer for $$$i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$; $$$b_{i} \\neq a_{i}$$$ for $$$i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$; $$$b_{1} < b_{2} < \\ldots < b_{n}$$$. Find the minimum value of $$$b_{n}$$$ among all good sequences $$$b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{9}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer â€” the minimum value of $$$b_{n}$$$ among all good sequences $$$b$$$.",
