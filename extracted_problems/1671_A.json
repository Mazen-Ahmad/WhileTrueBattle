  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$. You have to determine whether it is possible to build the string $$$s$$$ out of strings aa , aaa , bb and/or bbb by concatenating them. You can use the strings aa , aaa , bb and/or bbb any number of times and in any order. For example: aaaabbb can be built as aa $$$+$$$ aa $$$+$$$ bbb ; bbaaaaabbb can be built as bb $$$+$$$ aaa $$$+$$$ aa $$$+$$$ bbb ; aaaaaa can be built as aa $$$+$$$ aa $$$+$$$ aa ; abab cannot be built from aa , aaa , bb and/or bbb .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 50$$$), consisting of characters a and/or b .",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if it is possible to build the string $$$s$$$. Otherwise, print NO . You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES , yes , Yes will all be recognized as positive answer, NO , no and nO will all be recognized as negative answer).",
