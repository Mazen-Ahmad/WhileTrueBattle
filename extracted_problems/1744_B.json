  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Process $$$q$$$ queries of two types: query of the form \" 0 $$$x_j$$$ \": add the value $$$x_j$$$ to all even elements of the array $$$a$$$, query of the form \" 1 $$$x_j$$$ \": add the value $$$x_j$$$ to all odd elements of the array $$$a$$$. Note that when processing the query, we look specifically at the odd/even value of $$$a_i$$$, not its index. After processing each query, print the sum of the elements of the array $$$a$$$. Please note that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n$$$, $$$q \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries. The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers: $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$. The following $$$q$$$ lines contain queries as two integers $$$type_j$$$ and $$$x_j$$$ $$$(0 \\leq type_j \\leq 1$$$, $$$1 \\leq x_j \\leq 10^4$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases in a test does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. Similarly, the sum of values $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$q$$$ numbers: the sum of the elements of the array $$$a$$$ after processing a query.",
