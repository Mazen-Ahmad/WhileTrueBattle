  "statement": "To AmShZ, all arrays are equal, but some arrays are more-equal than others. Specifically, the arrays consisting of $$$n$$$ elements from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ that can be turned into permutations of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ by adding a non-negative integer to each element. Mashtali who wants to appear in every problem statement thinks that an array $$$b$$$ consisting of $$$k$$$ elements is compatible with a more-equal array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ elements if for each $$$1 \\le i \\le k$$$ we have $$$1 \\le b_i \\le n$$$ and also $$$a_{b_1} = a_{b_2} = \\ldots = a_{b_k}$$$. Find the number of pairs of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that $$$a$$$ is a more-equal array consisting of $$$n$$$ elements and $$$b$$$ is an array compatible with $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$k$$$ elements modulo $$$998244353$$$. Note that the elements of $$$b$$$ are not necessarily distinct , same holds for $$$a$$$.",
