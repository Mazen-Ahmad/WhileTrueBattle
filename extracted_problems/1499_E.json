  "statement": "You are given two strings $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, both consist only of lowercase Latin letters. Let $$$|s|$$$ be the length of string $$$s$$$. Let's call a sequence $$$a$$$ a merging sequence if it consists of exactly $$$|x|$$$ zeros and exactly $$$|y|$$$ ones in some order. A merge $$$z$$$ is produced from a sequence $$$a$$$ by the following rules: if $$$a_i=0$$$, then remove a letter from the beginning of $$$x$$$ and append it to the end of $$$z$$$; if $$$a_i=1$$$, then remove a letter from the beginning of $$$y$$$ and append it to the end of $$$z$$$. Two merging sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are different if there is some position $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$. Let's call a string $$$z$$$ chaotic if for all $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$|z|$$$ $$$z_{i-1} \\neq z_i$$$. Let $$$s[l,r]$$$ for some $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le |s|$$$ be a substring of consecutive letters of $$$s$$$, starting from position $$$l$$$ and ending at position $$$r$$$ inclusive. Let $$$f(l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2)$$$ be the number of different merging sequences of $$$x[l_1,r_1]$$$ and $$$y[l_2,r_2]$$$ that produce chaotic merges. Note that only non-empty substrings of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are considered. Calculate $$$\\sum \\limits_{1 \\le l_1 \\le r_1 \\le |x| \\\\ 1 \\le l_2 \\le r_2 \\le |y|} f(l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2)$$$. Output the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a string $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le |x| \\le 1000$$$). The second line contains a string $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le |y| \\le 1000$$$). Both strings consist only of lowercase Latin letters.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer â€” the sum of $$$f(l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2)$$$ over $$$1 \\le l_1 \\le r_1 \\le |x|$$$ and $$$1 \\le l_2 \\le r_2 \\le |y|$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
