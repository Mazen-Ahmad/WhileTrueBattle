  "statement": "One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose, the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks and a huge number of shells for launching. Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation launches fireworks every $$$a$$$ minutes (i.e., after $$$a, 2 \\cdot a, 3 \\cdot a, \\dots$$$ minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every $$$b$$$ minutes (i.e., after $$$b, 2 \\cdot b, 3 \\cdot b, \\dots$$$ minutes after launch). Each firework is visible in the sky for $$$m + 1$$$ minutes after launch, i.e., if a firework was launched after $$$x$$$ minutes after the installations were turned on, it will be visible every minute from $$$x$$$ to $$$x + m$$$, inclusive. If one firework was launched $$$m$$$ minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one minute. What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b, m \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the frequency of launching for the first installation, the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.",
  "outputFormat": "For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.",
