  "statement": "Petya and his friend, robot Petya++, like to solve exciting math problems. One day Petya++ came up with the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ and wrote the following equality on the board: $$$$$$n\\ \\&\\ (n+1)\\ \\&\\ \\dots\\ \\&\\ m = x,$$$$$$ where $$$\\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation . Then he suggested his friend Petya find such a minimal $$$m$$$ ($$$m \\ge n$$$) that the equality on the board holds. Unfortunately, Petya couldn't solve this problem in his head and decided to ask for computer help. He quickly wrote a program and found the answer. Can you solve this difficult problem?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$0\\le n, x \\le 10^{18}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For every test case, output the smallest possible value of $$$m$$$ such that equality holds. If the equality does not hold for any $$$m$$$, print $$$-1$$$ instead. We can show that if the required $$$m$$$ exists, it does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^{18}$$$.",
