  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ numbers. There are also $$$q$$$ queries of the form $$$s, d, k$$$. For each query $$$q$$$, find the sum of elements $$$a_s + a_{s+d} \\cdot 2 + \\dots + a_{s + d \\cdot (k - 1)} \\cdot k$$$. In other words, for each query, it is necessary to find the sum of $$$k$$$ elements of the array with indices starting from the $$$s$$$-th, taking steps of size $$$d$$$, multiplying it by the serial number of the element in the resulting sequence.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. Next lines contain descriptions of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains two numbers $$$n, q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, ... a_n$$$ ($$$-10^8 \\le a_1, ..., a_n \\le 10^8$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$. The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain three integers $$$s$$$, $$$d$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le s, d, k \\le n$$$, $$$s + d\\cdot (k - 1) \\le n$$$ ). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5 $$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print $$$q$$$ numbers in a separate line — the desired sums, separated with space.",
