  "statement": "Let us call two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ adjacent if $$$\\frac{lcm(x, y)}{gcd(x, y)}$$$ is a perfect square. For example, $$$3$$$ and $$$12$$$ are adjacent, but $$$6$$$ and $$$9$$$ are not. Here $$$gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, and $$$lcm(x, y)$$$ denotes the least common multiple (LCM) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Each second the following happens: each element $$$a_i$$$ of the array is replaced by the product of all elements of the array (including itself), that are adjacent to the current value. Let $$$d_i$$$ be the number of adjacent elements to $$$a_i$$$ (including $$$a_i$$$ itself). The beauty of the array is defined as $$$\\max_{1 \\le i \\le n} d_i$$$. You are given $$$q$$$ queries: each query is described by an integer $$$w$$$, and you have to output the beauty of the array after $$$w$$$ seconds.",
  "inputFormat": "The first input line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5)$$$ — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$) — array elements. The next line contain a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. The following $$$q$$$ lines contain a single integer $$$w$$$ each ($$$0 \\le w \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the queries themselves. It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of values $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$",
  "outputFormat": "For each query output a single integer — the beauty of the array at the corresponding moment.",
