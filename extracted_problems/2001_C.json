  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. Misuki has chosen a secret tree with $$$n$$$ nodes, indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and asked you to guess it by using queries of the following type: \"? a b\" — Misuki will tell you which node $$$x$$$ minimizes $$$|d(a,x) - d(b,x)|$$$, where $$$d(x,y)$$$ is the distance between nodes $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. If more than one such node exists, Misuki will tell you the one which minimizes $$$d(a,x)$$$. Find out the structure of Misuki's secret tree using at most $$$15n$$$ queries!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 200$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line with an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 1000$$$), the number of nodes in the tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
