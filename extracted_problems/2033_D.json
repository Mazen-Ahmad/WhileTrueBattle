  "statement": "After a trip with Sakurako, Kousuke was very scared because he forgot about his programming assignment. In this assignment, the teacher gave him an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers and asked him to calculate the number of non-overlapping segments of the array $$$a$$$, such that each segment is considered beautiful . A segment $$$[l,r]$$$ is considered beautiful if $$$a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_{r-1} + a_r=0$$$. For a fixed array $$$a$$$, your task is to compute the maximum number of non-overlapping beautiful segments.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains the number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of $$$2$$$ lines. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$3\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-overlapping beautiful segments.",
