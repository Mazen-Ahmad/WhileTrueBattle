  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ houses in your city arranged on an axis at points $$$h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n$$$. You want to build a new house for yourself and consider two options where to place it: points $$$p_1$$$ and $$$p_2$$$. As you like visiting friends, you have calculated in advance the distances from both options to all existing houses. More formally, you have calculated two arrays $$$d_1$$$, $$$d_2$$$: $$$d_{i, j} = \\left|p_i - h_j\\right|$$$, where $$$|x|$$$ defines the absolute value of $$$x$$$. After a long time of inactivity you have forgotten the locations of the houses $$$h$$$ and the options $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$. But your diary still keeps two arrays — $$$d_1$$$, $$$d_2$$$, whose authenticity you doubt. Also, the values inside each array could be shuffled , so values at the same positions of $$$d_1$$$ and $$$d_2$$$ may correspond to different houses. Pay attention, that values from one array could not get to another, in other words, all values in the array $$$d_1$$$ correspond the distances from $$$p_1$$$ to the houses, and in the array $$$d_2$$$ — from $$$p_2$$$ to the houses. Also pay attention, that the locations of the houses $$$h_i$$$ and the considered options $$$p_j$$$ could match. For example, the next locations are correct: $$$h = \\{1, 0, 3, 3\\}$$$, $$$p = \\{1, 1\\}$$$, that could correspond to already shuffled $$$d_1 = \\{0, 2, 1, 2\\}$$$, $$$d_2 = \\{2, 2, 1, 0\\}$$$. Check whether there are locations of houses $$$h$$$ and considered points $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, for which the founded arrays of distances would be correct. If it is possible, find appropriate locations of houses and considered options.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^3$$$) — the length of arrays $$$d_1$$$, $$$d_2$$$. The next two lines contain $$$n$$$ integers each: arrays $$$d_1$$$ and $$$d_2$$$ ($$$0 \\le d_{i, j} \\le 10^9$$$) respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^3$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line \" NO \" if there is no answer. Otherwise output three lines. The first line must contain \" YES \". In the second line, print $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n$$$. In the third line print two integers $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$. It must be satisfied that $$$0 \\le h_i, p_1, p_2 \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$$$. We can show that if there is an answer, then there is one satisfying these constraints. If there are several answers, output any of them.",
