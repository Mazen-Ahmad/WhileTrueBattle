  "statement": "Xomu - Last Dance â € You are given an integer $$$n$$$. For each $$$(m, k)$$$ such that $$$3 \\leq m \\leq n+1$$$ and $$$0 \\leq k \\leq n-1$$$, count the permutations of $$$[1, 2, ..., n]$$$ such that $$$p_i + p_{i+1} \\geq m$$$ for exactly $$$k$$$ indices $$$i$$$, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of a single line, which contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 4000$$$, $$$1 \\leq x < 1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Let $$$a_{m,k}$$$ be the answer for the pair $$$(m, k)$$$, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. Let $$$$$$\\large S = \\sum_{m=3}^{n+1} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_{m,k}x^{mn+k}\\phantom{0}.$$$$$$ Output a single line with an integer: $$$S$$$ modulo $$$1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$. Note that using two different modulos is intentional. We want you to calculate all the $$$a_{m,k}$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$, then treat them like integers in the range $$$[0, 998\\,244\\,352]$$$, and hash them modulo $$$1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$.",
