  "statement": "Define the range of a non-empty array to be the maximum value minus the minimum value. For example, the range of $$$[1,4,2]$$$ is $$$4-1=3$$$. You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n \\geq 3$$$. It is guaranteed $$$a$$$ is sorted . You have to color each element of $$$a$$$ red or blue so that: the range of the red elements does not equal the range of the blue elements, and there is at least one element of each color. If there does not exist any such coloring, you should report it. If there are multiple valid colorings, you can print any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed $$$a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq a_{n - 1} \\leq a_{n}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is impossible to color $$$a$$$ to satisfy all the constraints, output $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$. Otherwise, first output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$. Then, output a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. For $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, if you color $$$a_i$$$ red, $$$s_i$$$ should be $$$\\texttt{R}$$$. For $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, if you color $$$a_i$$$ blue, $$$s_i$$$ should be $$$\\texttt{B}$$$.",
