  "statement": "You are given an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. In one operation, you can choose any number of the array and add $$$1$$$ to it. Make at most $$$2n$$$ operations so that the array satisfies the following property: $$$a_{i+1}$$$ is not divisible by $$$a_i$$$, for each $$$i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1$$$. You do not need to minimize the number of operations.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 10^4$$$) — the length of the given array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\leq 10^9$$$) — the given array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer on a separate line. In the only line, print $$$n$$$ integers — the resulting array $$$a$$$ after applying at most $$$2n$$$ operations. We can show that an answer always exists under the given constraints. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
