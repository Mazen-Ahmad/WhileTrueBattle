  "statement": "For a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$, we define the function: $$$$$$ f(p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lvert p_i - i \\rvert $$$$$$ You are given a number $$$n$$$. You need to compute how many distinct values the function $$$f(p)$$$ can take when considering all possible permutations of the numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 500$$$) — the number of numbers in the permutations.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of distinct values of the function $$$f(p)$$$ for the given length of permutations.",
