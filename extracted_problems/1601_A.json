  "statement": "You are given array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, consisting of non-negative integers. Let's define operation of \"elimination\" with integer parameter $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$) as follows: Choose $$$k$$$ distinct array indices $$$1 \\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k \\le n$$$. Calculate $$$x = a_{i_1} ~ \\& ~ a_{i_2} ~ \\& ~ \\ldots ~ \\& ~ a_{i_k}$$$, where $$$\\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation (notes section contains formal definition). Subtract $$$x$$$ from each of $$$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\ldots, a_{i_k}$$$; all other elements remain untouched. Find all possible values of $$$k$$$, such that it's possible to make all elements of array $$$a$$$ equal to $$$0$$$ using a finite number of elimination operations with parameter $$$k$$$. It can be proven that exists at least one possible $$$k$$$ for any array $$$a$$$. Note that you firstly choose $$$k$$$ and only after that perform elimination operations with value $$$k$$$ you've chosen initially .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 200\\,000$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i < 2^{30}$$$) — array $$$a$$$ itself. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$200\\,000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print all values $$$k$$$, such that it's possible to make all elements of $$$a$$$ equal to $$$0$$$ in a finite number of elimination operations with the given parameter $$$k$$$. Print them in increasing order.",
