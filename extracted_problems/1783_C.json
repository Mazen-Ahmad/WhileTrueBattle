  "statement": "You are participating in Yet Another Tournament. There are $$$n + 1$$$ participants: you and $$$n$$$ other opponents, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each two participants will play against each other exactly once. If the opponent $$$i$$$ plays against the opponent $$$j$$$, he wins if and only if $$$i > j$$$. When the opponent $$$i$$$ plays against you, everything becomes a little bit complicated. In order to get a win against opponent $$$i$$$, you need to prepare for the match for at least $$$a_i$$$ minutes — otherwise, you lose to that opponent. You have $$$m$$$ minutes in total to prepare for matches, but you can prepare for only one match at one moment. In other words, if you want to win against opponents $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$$$, you need to spend $$$a_{p_1} + a_{p_2} + \\dots + a_{p_k}$$$ minutes for preparation — and if this number is greater than $$$m$$$, you cannot achieve a win against all of these opponents at the same time. The final place of each contestant is equal to the number of contestants with strictly more wins $$$+$$$ $$$1$$$. For example, if $$$3$$$ contestants have $$$5$$$ wins each, $$$1$$$ contestant has $$$3$$$ wins and $$$2$$$ contestants have $$$1$$$ win each, then the first $$$3$$$ participants will get the $$$1$$$-st place, the fourth one gets the $$$4$$$-th place and two last ones get the $$$5$$$-th place. Calculate the minimum possible place (lower is better) you can achieve if you can't prepare for the matches more than $$$m$$$ minutes in total.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$0 \\le m \\le \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{a_i}$$$) — the number of your opponents and the total time you have for preparation. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the time you need to prepare in order to win against the $$$i$$$-th opponent. It's guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the minimum possible place you can take if you can prepare for the matches no more than $$$m$$$ minutes in total.",
