  "statement": "For a set of pairs $$$S = \\{(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \\ldots, (a_m, b_m)\\}$$$, where $$$a_i < b_i$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le m$$$, we define $$$f(S)$$$ and $$$g(S)$$$ as follows: Treating each $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$ as a segment on the number line, $$$f(S)$$$ is the length of their union. Formally, $$$f(S)$$$ is the number of integers $$$x$$$ such that there exists an $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq m$$$) where $$$[x, x+1] \\subseteq [a_i, b_i]$$$. Treating each $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$ as an undirected edge in a graph, $$$g(S)$$$ is the number of nodes that lie on at least one simple cycle with at least $$$3$$$ edges. Formally, $$$g(S)$$$ is the number of nodes $$$x_1$$$ such that there exists a path $$$x_1 \\to x_2 \\to \\ldots \\to x_k \\to x_1$$$ in the graph, where $$$k \\geq 3$$$ and all $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k$$$ are distinct. For example, $$$S = \\{(1,2), (2,4), (1,4), (4,5),(6,7)\\}$$$, we can get $$$f(S) = 5$$$ and $$$g(S) = 3$$$. You are given $$$n$$$ distinct pairs. Your task is to select a subset $$$S'$$$ of these pairs such that $$$f(S') - g(S')$$$ is maximized. You need to output the indices of the selected pairs.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^3$$$). Next $$$n$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i < b_i \\le 2n$$$), representing a pair. It is guaranteed that all pairs are distinct within the same test case. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$9 \\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, the first line contains an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$) — the size of the subset $$$S'$$$. Next line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le i_1 , i_2 , \\ldots , i_k \\le n$$$) — the indices of the selected pairs. Note the indices must be distinct .",
