  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. Find two permutations$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$\\max(p_i,q_i)=a_i$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ or report that such $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ do not exist. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there do not exist $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ that satisfy the conditions, output \" NO \" (without quotes). Otherwise, output \" YES \" (without quotes) and then output $$$2$$$ lines. The first line should contain $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ and the second line should contain $$$n$$$ integers $$$q_1,q_2,\\ldots,q_n$$$. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. You can output \" YES \" and \" NO \" in any case (for example, strings \" yEs \", \" yes \" and \" Yes \" will be recognized as a positive response).",
