  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ in binary representation. Let $$$g(x, y)$$$ be equal to the bitwise XOR of all integers from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$ inclusive (that is $$$x \\oplus (x+1) \\oplus \\dots \\oplus (y-1) \\oplus y$$$). Let's define $$$f(l, r)$$$ as the maximum of all values of $$$g(x, y)$$$ satisfying $$$l \\le x \\le y \\le r$$$. Output $$$f(l, r)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$) — the length of the binary representation of $$$r$$$. The second line contains the binary representation of $$$l$$$ — a string of length $$$n$$$ consisting of digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ ($$$0 \\le l < 2^n$$$). The third line contains the binary representation of $$$r$$$ — a string of length $$$n$$$ consisting of digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ ($$$0 \\le r < 2^n$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$l \\le r$$$. The binary representation of $$$r$$$ does not contain any extra leading zeros (if $$$r=0$$$, the binary representation of it consists of a single zero). The binary representation of $$$l$$$ is preceded with leading zeros so that its length is equal to $$$n$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "In a single line output the value of $$$f(l, r)$$$ for the given pair of $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ in binary representation without extra leading zeros.",
