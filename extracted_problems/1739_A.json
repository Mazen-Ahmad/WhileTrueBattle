  "statement": "There is a chess board of size $$$n \\times m$$$. The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. Let's call a cell isolated if a knight placed in that cell can't move to any other cell on the board. Recall that a chess knight moves two cells in one direction and one cell in a perpendicular direction: Find any isolated cell on the board. If there are no such cells, print any cell on the board.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 64$$$) — the number of testcases. The only line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 8$$$) — the number of rows and columns of the board.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print two integers — the row and the column of any isolated cell on the board. If there are no such cells, print any cell on the board.",
