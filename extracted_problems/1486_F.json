  "statement": "You are given a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices, and $$$m$$$ simple vertex paths. Your task is to find how many pairs of those paths intersect at exactly one vertex. More formally you have to find the number of pairs $$$(i, j)$$$ $$$(1 \\leq i < j \\leq m)$$$ such that $$$path_i$$$ and $$$path_j$$$ have exactly one vertex in common.",
  "inputFormat": "First line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5)$$$. Next $$$n - 1$$$ lines describe the tree. Each line contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ $$$(1 \\leq u, v \\leq n)$$$ describing an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. Next line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \\leq m \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5)$$$. Next $$$m$$$ lines describe paths. Each line describes a path by it's two endpoints $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ $$$(1 \\leq u, v \\leq n)$$$. The given path is all the vertices on the shortest path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ (including $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Output a single integer â€” the number of pairs of paths that intersect at exactly one vertex.",
