  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of distinct integers. In one operation, you may either: choose a nonempty prefix $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$a$$$ and replace it with its minimum value, or choose a nonempty suffix $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ of $$$a$$$ and replace it with its maximum value. Note that you may choose the entire array $$$a$$$. For each element $$$a_i$$$, determine if there exists some sequence of operations to transform $$$a$$$ into $$$[a_i]$$$; that is, make the array $$$a$$$ consist of only one element, which is $$$a_i$$$. Output your answer as a binary string of length $$$n$$$, where the $$$i$$$-th character is $$$1$$$ if there exists a sequence to transform $$$a$$$ into $$$[a_i]$$$, and $$$0$$$ otherwise. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A prefix of an array is a subarray consisting of the first $$$k$$$ elements of the array, for some integer $$$k$$$. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A suffix of an array is a subarray consisting of the last $$$k$$$ elements of the array, for some integer $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed that all $$$a_i$$$ are distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a binary string of length $$$n$$$ — the $$$i$$$-th character should be $$$1$$$ if there exists a sequence of operations as described above, and $$$0$$$ otherwise.",
