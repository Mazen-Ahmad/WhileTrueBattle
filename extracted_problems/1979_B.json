  "statement": "You are given two distinct non-negative integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Consider two infinite sequences $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots$$$, where $$$a_n = n \\oplus x$$$; $$$b_n = n \\oplus y$$$. Here, $$$x \\oplus y$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. For example, with $$$x = 6$$$, the first $$$8$$$ elements of sequence $$$a$$$ will look as follows: $$$[7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \\ldots]$$$. Note that the indices of elements start with $$$1$$$. Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment$$$^\\dagger$$$ of sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. In other words, find the maximum integer $$$m$$$ such that $$$a_i = b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \\ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1}$$$ for some $$$i, j \\ge 1$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$A subsegment of sequence $$$p$$$ is a sequence $$$p_l,p_{l+1},\\ldots,p_r$$$, where $$$1 \\le l \\le r$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$0 \\le x, y \\le 10^9, x \\neq y$$$) — the parameters of the sequences.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common subsegment.",
