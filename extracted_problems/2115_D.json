  "statement": "Gellyfish and Flower are playing a game. The game consists of two arrays of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ and $$$b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n$$$, along with a binary string $$$c_1c_2\\ldots c_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. There is also an integer $$$x$$$ which is initialized to $$$0$$$. The game consists of $$$n$$$ rounds. For $$$i = 1,2,\\ldots,n$$$, the round proceeds as follows: If $$$c_i = \\mathtt{0}$$$, Gellyfish will be the active player. Otherwise, if $$$c_i = \\mathtt{1}$$$, Flower will be the active player. The active player will perform exactly one of the following operations: Set $$$x:=x \\oplus a_i$$$. Set $$$x:=x \\oplus b_i$$$. Here, $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation . Gellyfish wants to minimize the final value of $$$ x $$$ after $$$ n $$$ rounds, while Flower wants to maximize it. Find the final value of $$$ x $$$ after all $$$ n $$$ rounds if both players play optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of rounds of the game. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i < 2^{60}$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq b_i < 2^{60}$$$). The fourth line of each test case contains a binary string $$$c$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the final value of $$$ x $$$ after all $$$ n $$$ rounds.",
