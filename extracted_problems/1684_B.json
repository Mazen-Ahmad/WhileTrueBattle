  "statement": "You are given three positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$a < b < c$$$). You have to find three positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$ such that: $$$$$$x \\bmod y = a,$$$$$$ $$$$$$y \\bmod z = b,$$$$$$ $$$$$$z \\bmod x = c.$$$$$$ Here $$$p \\bmod q$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$p$$$ by $$$q$$$. It is possible to show that for such constraints the answer always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. Each test case contains a single line with three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\le a < b < c \\le 10^8$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output three positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y, z \\le 10^{18}$$$) such that $$$x \\bmod y = a$$$, $$$y \\bmod z = b$$$, $$$z \\bmod x = c$$$. You can output any correct answer.",
