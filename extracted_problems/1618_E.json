  "statement": "$$$n$$$ towns are arranged in a circle sequentially. The towns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in clockwise order. In the $$$i$$$-th town, there lives a singer with a repertoire of $$$a_i$$$ minutes for each $$$i \\in [1, n]$$$. Each singer visited all $$$n$$$ towns in clockwise order, starting with the town he lives in, and gave exactly one concert in each town. In addition, in each town, the $$$i$$$-th singer got inspired and came up with a song that lasts $$$a_i$$$ minutes. The song was added to his repertoire so that he could perform it in the rest of the cities. Hence, for the $$$i$$$-th singer, the concert in the $$$i$$$-th town will last $$$a_i$$$ minutes, in the $$$(i + 1)$$$-th town the concert will last $$$2 \\cdot a_i$$$ minutes, ..., in the $$$((i + k) \\bmod n + 1)$$$-th town the duration of the concert will be $$$(k + 2) \\cdot a_i$$$, ..., in the town $$$((i + n - 2) \\bmod n + 1)$$$ — $$$n \\cdot a_i$$$ minutes. You are given an array of $$$b$$$ integer numbers, where $$$b_i$$$ is the total duration of concerts in the $$$i$$$-th town. Reconstruct any correct sequence of positive integers $$$a$$$ or say that it is impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 4 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of cities. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^{9}$$$) — the total duration of concerts in $$$i$$$-th city. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer as follows: If there is no suitable sequence $$$a$$$, print NO . Otherwise, on the first line print YES , on the next line print the sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, where $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{9}$$$) is the initial duration of repertoire of the $$$i$$$-th singer. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
