  "statement": "You are given a positive integer $$$k$$$ and a set $$$S$$$ of all integers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ (inclusive). You can perform the following two-step operation any number of times (possibly zero): First, choose a number $$$x$$$ from the set $$$S$$$, such that there are at least $$$k$$$ multiples of $$$x$$$ in $$$S$$$ (including $$$x$$$ itself); Then, remove $$$x$$$ from $$$S$$$ (note that nothing else is removed). Find the maximum possible number of operations that can be performed.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\le l\\le r\\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1\\leq k\\le r-l+1$$$) — the minimum integer in $$$S$$$, the maximum integer in $$$S$$$, and the parameter $$$k$$$.",
