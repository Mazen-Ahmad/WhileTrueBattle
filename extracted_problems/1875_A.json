  "statement": "Flowey has planted a bomb in Snowdin! The bomb has a timer that is initially set to $$$b$$$. Every second, the timer will decrease by $$$1$$$. When the timer reaches $$$0$$$, the bomb will explode! To give the residents of Snowdin enough time to evacuate, you will need to delay the bomb from exploding for as long as possible. You have $$$n$$$ tools. Each tool can only be used at most once. If you use the $$$i$$$-th tool, the timer will increase by $$$x_i$$$. However, if the timer is changed to an integer larger than $$$a$$$, the timer will be set to $$$a$$$ due to a bug. More specifically, the following events will happen every second in the following order: You will choose some (possibly none) of your tools that have not been used before. If you choose the $$$i$$$-th tool, and the bomb's timer is currently set to $$$c$$$, the timer will be changed to $$$\\min(c + x_i, a)$$$. The timer decreases by $$$1$$$. If the timer reaches $$$0$$$, the bomb explodes. Jellyfish now wants to know the maximum time in seconds until the bomb explodes if the tools are used optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b \\leq a \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the maximum value of the bomb's timer, the initial value of the timer of the bomb and the number of tools. The second line of each test contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number the timer can increase by using the $$$i$$$-th tool. Note that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is not bounded.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum time in seconds until the bomb explodes.",
