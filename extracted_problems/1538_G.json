  "statement": "Polycarp has $$$x$$$ of red and $$$y$$$ of blue candies. Using them, he wants to make gift sets. Each gift set contains either $$$a$$$ red candies and $$$b$$$ blue candies, or $$$a$$$ blue candies and $$$b$$$ red candies. Any candy can belong to at most one gift set. Help Polycarp to find the largest number of gift sets he can create. For example, if $$$x = 10$$$, $$$y = 12$$$, $$$a = 5$$$, and $$$b = 2$$$, then Polycarp can make three gift sets: In the first set there will be $$$5$$$ red candies and $$$2$$$ blue candies; In the second set there will be $$$5$$$ blue candies and $$$2$$$ red candies; In the third set will be $$$5$$$ blue candies and $$$2$$$ red candies. Note that in this example there is one red candy that Polycarp does not use in any gift set.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single string containing four integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y, a, b \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one number â€” the maximum number of gift sets that Polycarp can make.",
