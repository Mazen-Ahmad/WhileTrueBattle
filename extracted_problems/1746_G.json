  "statement": "Anton decided to get ready for an Olympiad in Informatics. Ilya prepared $$$n$$$ tasks for him to solve. It is possible to submit the solution for the $$$i$$$-th task in the first $$$d_{i}$$$ days only. Anton cannot solve more than one task a day. Ilya estimated the usefulness of the $$$i$$$-th tasks as $$$r_{i}$$$ and divided the tasks into three topics, the topic of the $$$i$$$-th task is $$$type_{i}$$$. Anton wants to solve exactly $$$a$$$ tasks on the first topic, $$$b$$$ tasks on the second topic and $$$c$$$ tasks on the third topic. Tell Anton if it is possible to do so, and if it is, calculate the maximum total usefulness of the tasks he may solve.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n, a, b, c$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le a, b, c \\le n$$$). The following $$$n$$$ lines contain three integers each — $$$r_i, type_i, d_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le r_i \\le 10^{9}$$$, $$$1 \\le type_i \\le 3$$$, $$$1 \\le d_i \\le n$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print $$$-1$$$ if Anton cannot reach his goal; otherwise, print the maximum usefulness of the tasks he will solve.",
