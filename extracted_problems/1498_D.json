  "statement": "You have a malfunctioning microwave in which you want to put some bananas. You have $$$n$$$ time-steps before the microwave stops working completely. At each time-step, it displays a new operation. Let $$$k$$$ be the number of bananas in the microwave currently. Initially, $$$k = 0$$$. In the $$$i$$$-th operation, you are given three parameters $$$t_i$$$, $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ in the input. Based on the value of $$$t_i$$$, you must do one of the following: Type 1 : ($$$t_i=1$$$, $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$) — pick an $$$a_i$$$, such that $$$0 \\le a_i \\le y_i$$$, and perform the following update $$$a_i$$$ times: $$$k:=\\lceil (k + x_i) \\rceil$$$. Type 2 : ($$$t_i=2$$$, $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$) — pick an $$$a_i$$$, such that $$$0 \\le a_i \\le y_i$$$, and perform the following update $$$a_i$$$ times: $$$k:=\\lceil (k \\cdot x_i) \\rceil$$$. Note that $$$x_i$$$ can be a fractional value . See input format for more details. Also, $$$\\lceil x \\rceil$$$ is the smallest integer $$$\\ge x$$$. At the $$$i$$$-th time-step, you must apply the $$$i$$$-th operation exactly once. For each $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$, output the earliest time-step at which you can create exactly $$$j$$$ bananas. If you cannot create exactly $$$j$$$ bananas, output $$$-1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\le n \\le 200)$$$ and $$$m$$$ $$$(2 \\le m \\le 10^5)$$$. Then, $$$n$$$ lines follow, where the $$$i$$$-th line denotes the operation for the $$$i$$$-th timestep. Each such line contains three space-separated integers $$$t_i$$$, $$$x'_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le t_i \\le 2$$$, $$$1\\le y_i\\le m$$$). Note that you are given $$$x'_i$$$, which is $$$10^5 \\cdot x_i$$$. Thus, to obtain $$$x_i$$$, use the formula $$$x_i= \\dfrac{x'_i} {10^5}$$$. For type 1 operations, $$$1 \\le x'_i \\le 10^5 \\cdot m$$$, and for type 2 operations, $$$10^5 < x'_i \\le 10^5 \\cdot m$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$m$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th integer is the earliest time-step when you can obtain exactly $$$i$$$ bananas (or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible).",
