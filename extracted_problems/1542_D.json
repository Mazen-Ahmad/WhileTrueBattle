  "statement": "You are given a sequence $$$A$$$, where its elements are either in the form + x or - , where $$$x$$$ is an integer. For such a sequence $$$S$$$ where its elements are either in the form + x or - , define $$$f(S)$$$ as follows: iterate through $$$S$$$'s elements from the first one to the last one, and maintain a multiset $$$T$$$ as you iterate through it. for each element, if it's in the form + x , add $$$x$$$ to $$$T$$$; otherwise, erase the smallest element from $$$T$$$ (if $$$T$$$ is empty, do nothing). after iterating through all $$$S$$$'s elements, compute the sum of all elements in $$$T$$$. $$$f(S)$$$ is defined as the sum. The sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of the sequence $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be derived from $$$a$$$ by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For all $$$A$$$'s subsequences $$$B$$$, compute the sum of $$$f(B)$$$, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 500$$$) â€” the length of $$$A$$$. Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines begins with an operator + or - . If the operator is + , then it's followed by an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1\\le x<998\\,244\\,353$$$). The $$$i$$$-th line of those $$$n$$$ lines describes the $$$i$$$-th element in $$$A$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer, which is the answer to the problem, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
