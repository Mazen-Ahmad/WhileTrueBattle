  "statement": "Miriany's matchstick is a $$$2 \\times n$$$ grid that needs to be filled with characters A or B . He has already filled in the first row of the grid and would like you to fill in the second row. You must do so in a way such that the number of adjacent pairs of cells with different characters $$$^\\dagger$$$ is equal to $$$k$$$. If it is impossible, report so. $$$^\\dagger$$$ An adjacent pair of cells with different characters is a pair of cells $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ and $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$ ($$$1 \\le r_1, r_2 \\le 2$$$, $$$1 \\le c_1, c_2 \\le n$$$) such that $$$|r_1 - r_2| + |c_1 - c_2| = 1$$$ and the characters in $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ and $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$ are different.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line consists of an integer $$$t$$$, the number of test cases ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case has two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5, 0 \\leq k \\leq 3 \\cdot n$$$) – the number of columns of the matchstick, and the number of adjacent pairs of cells with different characters required. The following line contains string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters ($$$s_i$$$ is either A or B ) – Miriany's top row of the matchstick. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no way to fill the second row with the number of adjacent pairs of cells with different characters equals $$$k$$$, output \" NO \". Otherwise, output \" YES \". Then, print $$$n$$$ characters that a valid bottom row for Miriany's matchstick consists of. If there are several answers, output any of them.",
