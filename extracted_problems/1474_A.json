  "statement": "In the $$$2022$$$ year, Mike found two binary integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (both of them are written only by digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$) that can have leading zeroes. In order not to forget them, he wanted to construct integer $$$d$$$ in the following way: he creates an integer $$$c$$$ as a result of bitwise summing of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ without transferring carry , so $$$c$$$ may have one or more $$$2$$$-s. For example, the result of bitwise summing of $$$0110$$$ and $$$1101$$$ is $$$1211$$$ or the sum of $$$011000$$$ and $$$011000$$$ is $$$022000$$$; after that Mike replaces equal consecutive digits in $$$c$$$ by one digit, thus getting $$$d$$$. In the cases above after this operation, $$$1211$$$ becomes $$$121$$$ and $$$022000$$$ becomes $$$020$$$ (so, $$$d$$$ won't have equal consecutive digits). Unfortunately, Mike lost integer $$$a$$$ before he could calculate $$$d$$$ himself. Now, to cheer him up, you want to find any binary integer $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$d$$$ will be maximum possible as integer . Maximum possible as integer means that $$$102 > 21$$$, $$$012 < 101$$$, $$$021 = 21$$$ and so on.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line of each test case contains binary integer $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The integer $$$b$$$ consists only of digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ over all $$$t$$$ test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output one binary integer $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Note, that $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$ may have leading zeroes but must have the same length $$$n$$$.",
