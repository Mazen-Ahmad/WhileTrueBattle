  "statement": "You are given an array $$$[p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n]$$$, where all elements are distinct. You can perform several (possibly zero) operations with it. In one operation, you can choose a contiguous subsegment of $$$p$$$ and remove all elements from that subsegment, except for the minimum element on that subsegment. For example, if $$$p = [3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 2, 6]$$$ and you choose the subsegment from the $$$3$$$-rd element to the $$$6$$$-th element, the resulting array is $$$[3, 1, 2, 6]$$$. An array $$$a$$$ is called reachable if it can be obtained from $$$p$$$ using several (maybe zero) aforementioned operations. Calculate the number of reachable arrays, and print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le 10^9$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the number of reachable arrays, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
