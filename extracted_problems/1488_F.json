  "statement": "Recently, cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular. Ann decided that it was about time she started mining the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. Ann's computer is not very powerful, so Ann mines exactly $$$1$$$ Dogecoin per day. On the Internet, there are forecasts of the cost of $$$1$$$ dogecoin for the next $$$n$$$ days. Every day, Ann can sell any amount of dogecoin that she currently has. Note that if Ann mined Dogecoin on the $$$i$$$-th day, then she can sell it on the same day. Ann has not yet decided when to start mining. She has prepared $$$q$$$ possible plans and for each of them wants to know the maximum profit that she can get. Each of the plans is described by two numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ — the first and last days of mining. Note that Ann should not have any Dogecoin left after the $$$r$$$-th day.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le 10^6$$$), where $$$c_i$$$ is the cost of Dogecoin on the $$$i$$$-th day. The third line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of Ann's plans. The following $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) — the first and last days of mining.",
  "outputFormat": "For each Ann's plan print one integer — the maximum profit that she can get using this plan.",
