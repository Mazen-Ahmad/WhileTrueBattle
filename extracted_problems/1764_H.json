  "statement": "Doremy has $$$n$$$ buckets of paint which is represented by an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Bucket $$$i$$$ contains paint with color $$$a_i$$$. Initially, $$$a_i=i$$$. Doremy has $$$m$$$ segments $$$[l_i,r_i]$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$). Each segment describes an operation. Operation $$$i$$$ is performed as follows: For each $$$j$$$ such that $$$l_i < j \\leq r_i$$$, set $$$a_j := a_{l_i}$$$. Doremy also selects an integer $$$k$$$. She wants to know for each integer $$$x$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m-1$$$, the number of distinct colors in the array after performing operations $$$x \\bmod m +1, (x+1) \\bmod m + 1, \\ldots, (x+k-1) \\bmod m +1$$$. Can you help her calculate these values? Note that for each $$$x$$$ individually we start from the initial array and perform only the given $$$k$$$ operations in the given order.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\le n,m\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le m$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$, the total number of operations, and the integer that Doremy selects. The $$$i$$$-th line of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1\\le l_i\\le r_i\\le n$$$) — the bounds of the $$$i$$$-th segment.",
  "outputFormat": "Output $$$m$$$ integers. The $$$(x+1)$$$-th integer should be the number of distinct colors in the array if we start from the initial array and perform operations $$$x \\bmod m +1, (x+1) \\bmod m + 1, \\ldots, (x+k-1) \\bmod m +1$$$.",
