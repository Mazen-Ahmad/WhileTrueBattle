It absolutely does not matter what this program does, the only requirement is that it successfully compiles into an executable file in both C++ and Pascal. Please use the language Text to submit your solution. Just choose Text as a language in the submission form. The submitted file can't exceed 2048 bytes. It should compile fast on both compilers.",
