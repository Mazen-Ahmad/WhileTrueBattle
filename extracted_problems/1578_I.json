  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. Your goal is to find a circle on a plane by shooting rays and getting the distance to the circle as a result. Interactor has three hidden integer parameters that are determined in advance for each test, but which you don't know â€” $$$x_c$$$, $$$y_c$$$, and $$$r_c$$$. $$$(x_c, y_c)$$$ are coordinates of the circle's center and $$$r_c$$$ is its radius. The absolute values of $$$x_c$$$, $$$y_c$$$, and $$$r_c$$$ do not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and $$$1 \\leq r_c \\leq \\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} - 1$$$. You can shoot rays that extend from the origin $$$(0,0)$$$ and go via a point $$$(x_q,y_q)$$$ with the integer coordinates you specify. For each ray, you get a distance from the ray to the circle or $$$0$$$ if the ray intersects the circle.",
