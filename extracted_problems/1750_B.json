  "statement": "A binary string is a string consisting only of the characters 0 and 1 . You are given a binary string $$$s$$$. For some non-empty substring$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$t$$$ of string $$$s$$$ containing $$$x$$$ characters 0 and $$$y$$$ characters 1 , define its cost as: $$$x \\cdot y$$$, if $$$x > 0$$$ and $$$y > 0$$$; $$$x^2$$$, if $$$x > 0$$$ and $$$y = 0$$$; $$$y^2$$$, if $$$x = 0$$$ and $$$y > 0$$$. Given a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, find the maximum cost across all its non-empty substrings. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
