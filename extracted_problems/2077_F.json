  "statement": "Suppose you have two arrays $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$, each of length $$$k$$$. The pair $$$(c, d)$$$ is called good if $$$c$$$ can be changed to $$$d$$$ by performing the following operation any number of times. Select two distinct indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq k$$$, $$$i \\neq j$$$) and a nonnegative integer $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\leq x < 2^{30}$$$). Then, apply the following transformations: $$$c_i := c_i \\mathbin{\\&} x$$$, where $$$\\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation . $$$c_j := c_j \\mathbin{|} x$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation . You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$n$$$, containing nonnegative integers not exceeding $$$m$$$. You can perform two types of moves on these arrays any number of times: Select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) and set $$$a_i := a_i + 1$$$. Select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) and set $$$b_i := b_i + 1$$$. Note that the elements of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ may exceed $$$m$$$ at some point while performing the moves. Find the minimum number of moves required to make the pair $$$(a, b)$$$ good.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^6$$$) — the length of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and the maximum possible value in these arrays, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq m$$$) — denoting the array $$$a$$$. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq b_i \\leq m$$$) — denoting the array $$$b$$$. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the sum of all values of $$$n$$$ and the sum of all values of $$$m$$$ across all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of moves required to make the pair $$$(a, b)$$$ good.",
