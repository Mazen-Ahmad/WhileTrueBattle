  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ strings $$$s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n$$$ of length at most $$$\\mathbf{8}$$$. For each string $$$s_i$$$, determine if there exist two strings $$$s_j$$$ and $$$s_k$$$ such that $$$s_i = s_j + s_k$$$. That is, $$$s_i$$$ is the concatenation of $$$s_j$$$ and $$$s_k$$$. Note that $$$j$$$ can be equal to $$$k$$$. Recall that the concatenation of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ is $$$s + t = s_1 s_2 \\dots s_p t_1 t_2 \\dots t_q$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are the lengths of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ respectively. For example, concatenation of \" code \" and \" forces \" is \" codeforces \".",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of strings. Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains non-empty string $$$s_i$$$ of length at most $$$\\mathbf{8}$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. Among the given $$$n$$$ strings, there may be equal (duplicates). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a binary string of length $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th bit should be $$$\\texttt{1}$$$ if there exist two strings $$$s_j$$$ and $$$s_k$$$ where $$$s_i = s_j + s_k$$$, and $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ otherwise. Note that $$$j$$$ can be equal to $$$k$$$.",
