  "statement": "You're given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of only lowercase English letters. You must do the following operation exactly once: Choose any two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$). You can choose $$$i = j$$$. Set $$$s_i := s_j$$$. You need to minimize the number of distinct permutations$$$^\\dagger$$$ of $$$s$$$. Output any string with the smallest number of distinct permutations after performing exactly one operation. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation of the string is an arrangement of its characters into any order. For example, \" bac \" is a permutation of \" abc \" but \" bcc \" is not.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10$$$) â€” the length of string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The string contains only lowercase English letters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the required $$$s$$$ after applying exactly one operation. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
