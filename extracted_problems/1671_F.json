  "statement": "Calculate the number of permutations $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$ with exactly $$$k$$$ inversions (pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$p_i > p_j$$$) and exactly $$$x$$$ indices $$$i$$$ such that $$$p_i > p_{i+1}$$$. Yep, that's the whole problem. Good luck!",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 3 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line which contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 998244352$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 11$$$; $$$1 \\le x \\le 11$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
