  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$. In $$$1$$$ move, you can do one of the following actions: erase any digit of the number (it's acceptable that the number before the operation has exactly one digit and after the operation, it is \"empty\"); add one digit to the right . The actions may be performed in any order any number of times. Note that if, after deleting some digit from a number, it will contain leading zeroes, they will not be deleted. E.g. if you delete from the number $$$301$$$ the digit $$$3$$$, the result is the number $$$01$$$ (not $$$1$$$). You need to perform the minimum number of actions to make the number any power of $$$2$$$ (i.e. there's an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the resulting number is equal to $$$2^k$$$). The resulting number must not have leading zeroes . E.g. consider $$$n=1052$$$. The answer is equal to $$$2$$$. First, let's add to the right one digit $$$4$$$ (the result will be $$$10524$$$). Then let's erase the digit $$$5$$$, so the result will be $$$1024$$$ which is a power of $$$2$$$. E.g. consider $$$n=8888$$$. The answer is equal to $$$3$$$. Let's erase any of the digits $$$8$$$ three times. The result will be $$$8$$$ which is a power of $$$2$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output in a separate line one integer $$$m$$$ — the minimum number of moves to transform the number into any power of $$$2$$$.",
