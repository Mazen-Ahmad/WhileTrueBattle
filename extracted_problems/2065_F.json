  "statement": "Let's define the majority of a sequence of $$$k$$$ elements as the unique value that appears strictly more than $$$\\left \\lfloor {\\frac{k}{2}} \\right \\rfloor$$$ times. If such a value does not exist, then the sequence does not have a majority. For example, the sequence $$$[1,3,2,3,3]$$$ has a majority $$$3$$$ because it appears $$$3 > \\left \\lfloor {\\frac{5}{2}} \\right \\rfloor = 2$$$ times, but $$$[1,2,3,4,5]$$$ and $$$[1,3,2,3,4]$$$ do not have a majority. Skibidus found a tree$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$n$$$ vertices and an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Vertex $$$i$$$ has the value $$$a_i$$$ written on it, where $$$a_i$$$ is an integer in the range $$$[1, n]$$$. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, please determine if there exists a non-trivial simple path$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ such that $$$i$$$ is the majority of the sequence of integers written on the vertices that form the path. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A tree is a connected graph without cycles. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A sequence of vertices $$$v_1, v_2, ..., v_m$$$ ($$$m \\geq 2$$$) forms a non-trivial simple path if $$$v_i$$$ and $$$v_{i+1}$$$ are connected by an edge for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq m - 1$$$ and all $$$v_i$$$ are pairwise distinct. Note that the path must consist of at least $$$2$$$ vertices.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices. The second line of each test case contains $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the integers written on the vertices. Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$, denoting the two vertices connected by an edge ($$$1 \\le u_i,v_i \\le n$$$, $$$u_i \\neq v_i$$$). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ on a separate line. $$$s_i$$$ should be computed as follows: If there is a non-trivial path containing $$$i$$$ as the majority, $$$s_i$$$ is ' 1 '; Otherwise, $$$s_i$$$ is ' 0 '.",
