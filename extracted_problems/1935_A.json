  "statement": "Congratulations, you have been accepted to the Master's Assistance Center! However, you were extremely bored in class and got tired of doing nothing, so you came up with a game for yourself. You are given a string $$$s$$$ and an even integer $$$n$$$. There are two types of operations that you can apply to it: Add the reversed string $$$s$$$ to the end of the string $$$s$$$ (for example, if $$$s = $$$ cpm , then after applying the operation $$$s = $$$ cpmmpc ). Reverse the current string $$$s$$$ (for example, if $$$s = $$$ cpm , then after applying the operation $$$s = $$$ mpc ). It is required to determine the lexicographically smallest$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ string that can be obtained after applying exactly $$$n$$$ operations. Note that you can apply operations of different types in any order, but you must apply exactly $$$n$$$ operations in total. $$$^{\\dagger}$$$A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\ne b$$$; in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single even integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of operations applied to the string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\leq |s| \\leq 100$$$), consisting of lowercase English letters, — the string to which the operations are applied.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line — the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after applying exactly $$$n$$$ operations.",
