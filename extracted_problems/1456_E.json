  "statement": "Given integers $$$c_{0}, c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{k-1}$$$ we can define the cost of a number $$$0 \\le x < 2^{k}$$$ as $$$p(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\left( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2^{i}} \\right\\rfloor \\bmod 2 \\right) \\cdot c_{i}$$$. In other words, the cost of number $$$x$$$ is the sum of $$$c_{i}$$$ over the bits of $$$x$$$ which are equal to one. Let's define the cost of array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n \\ge 2$$$ with elements from $$$[0, 2^{k})$$$ as follows: $$$cost(a) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n - 1} p(a_{i} \\oplus a_{i+1})$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes bitwise exclusive OR operation. You have to construct an array of length $$$n$$$ with minimal cost, given that each element should belong to the given segment: $$$l_{i} \\le a_{i} \\le r_{i}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 50$$$) — the size of an array and bit length of the numbers in question. Next $$$n$$$ lines contain the restrictions for elements of the array: the $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$l_{i}$$$ and $$$r_{i}$$$ ($$$0 \\le l_{i} \\le r_{i} < 2^{k}$$$). The last line contains integers $$$c_{0}, c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{k-1}$$$ ($$$0 \\le c_{i} \\le 10^{12}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Output one integer — the minimal cost of an array satisfying all the restrictions.",
