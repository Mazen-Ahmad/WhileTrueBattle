  "statement": "We say that a positive integer $$$n$$$ is $$$k$$$-good for some positive integer $$$k$$$ if $$$n$$$ can be expressed as a sum of $$$k$$$ positive integers which give $$$k$$$ distinct remainders when divided by $$$k$$$. Given a positive integer $$$n$$$, find some $$$k \\geq 2$$$ so that $$$n$$$ is $$$k$$$-good or tell that such a $$$k$$$ does not exist.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line with an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a line with a value of $$$k$$$ such that $$$n$$$ is $$$k$$$-good ($$$k \\geq 2$$$), or $$$-1$$$ if $$$n$$$ is not $$$k$$$-good for any $$$k$$$. If there are multiple valid values of $$$k$$$, you can print any of them.",
