  "statement": "You're given a permutation$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p_1, \\ldots, p_n$$$ such that $$$\\max(p_i, p_{i+1}) > p_{i+2}$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n-2$$$. Compute the sum of the length of the longest decreasing subsequence$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ of the subarray $$$[p_l, p_{l+1}, \\ldots, p_r]$$$ over all pairs $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$Given an array $$$b$$$ of size $$$|b|$$$, a decreasing subsequence of length $$$k$$$ is a sequence of indices $$$i_1, \\ldots, i_k$$$ such that: $$$1 \\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k \\leq |b|$$$ $$$b_{i_1} > b_{i_2} > \\ldots > b_{i_k}$$$",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 500\\,000$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$, $$$p_i$$$ are pairwise distinct). It is guaranteed that $$$\\max(p_i, p_{i+1}) > p_{i+2}$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n-2$$$. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500\\,000$$$.",
