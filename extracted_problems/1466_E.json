  "statement": "Only a few know that Pan and Apollo weren't only battling for the title of the GOAT musician. A few millenniums later, they also challenged each other in math (or rather in fast calculations). The task they got to solve is the following: Let $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ be the sequence of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. Find this value: $$$$$$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^n (x_i \\, \\& \\, x_j) \\cdot (x_j \\, | \\, x_k)$$$$$$ Here $$$\\&$$$ denotes the bitwise and, and $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise or. Pan and Apollo could solve this in a few seconds. Can you do it too? For convenience, find the answer modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1\\,000$$$) denoting the number of test cases, then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case consists of a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$), the length of the sequence. The second one contains $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq x_i < 2^{60}$$$), elements of the sequence. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$t$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain the answer to the $$$i$$$-th text case.",
