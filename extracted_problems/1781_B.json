  "statement": "A company of $$$n$$$ people is planning a visit to the cinema. Every person can either go to the cinema or not. That depends on how many other people will go. Specifically, every person $$$i$$$ said: \"I want to go to the cinema if and only if at least $$$a_i$$$ other people will go, not counting myself \". That means that person $$$i$$$ will become sad if: they go to the cinema, and strictly less than $$$a_i$$$ other people go; or they don't go to the cinema, and at least $$$a_i$$$ other people go. In how many ways can a set of people going to the cinema be chosen so that nobody becomes sad?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of people in the company. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le n - 1$$$) — integers from peoples' claims. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the number of different ways to choose a set of people going to the cinema so that nobody becomes sad.",
