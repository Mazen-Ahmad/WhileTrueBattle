  "statement": "Let's define $$$f(S)$$$. Let $$$S$$$ be a multiset (i.e., it can contain repeated elements) of non-negative integers. In one operation, you can choose any non-empty subset of $$$S$$$ (which can also contain repeated elements), remove this subset (all elements in it) from $$$S$$$, and add the MEX of the removed subset to $$$S$$$. You can perform any number of such operations. After all the operations, $$$S$$$ should contain exactly $$$1$$$ number. $$$f(S)$$$ is the largest number that could remain in $$$S$$$ after any sequence of operations. You are given an array of non-negative integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. For each of its $$$n$$$ prefixes, calculate $$$f(S)$$$ if $$$S$$$ is the corresponding prefix (for the $$$i$$$-th prefix, $$$S$$$ consists of the first $$$i$$$ elements of array $$$a$$$). The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance: The MEX of $$$[2,2,1]$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array. The MEX of $$$[3,1,0,1]$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not. The MEX of $$$[0,3,1,2]$$$ is $$$4$$$, because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ belong to the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ values across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ numbers: $$$f(S)$$$ for each of the $$$n$$$ prefixes of array $$$a$$$.",
