  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ sticks, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The length of the $$$i$$$-th stick is $$$a_i$$$. You need to answer $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, you are given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l < r \\le n$$$, $$$r - l + 1 \\ge 6$$$). Determine whether it is possible to choose $$$6$$$ distinct sticks from the sticks numbered $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$, to form $$$2$$$ non-degenerate triangles$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A triangle with side lengths $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ is called non-degenerate if: $$$a < b + c$$$, $$$b < a + c$$$, and $$$c < a + b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$6 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of sticks and the number of queries respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — $$$a_i$$$ denotes the length of the $$$i$$$-th stick. Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l < r \\le n$$$, $$$r - l + 1 \\ge 6$$$) — the parameters of each query.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, output \" YES \" (without quotes) if it is possible to form $$$2$$$ triangles, and \" NO \" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \", and \" YES \" will be recognized as positive responses.",
