  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. There is a positive integer $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$ that you have to guess. In one query you can choose two positive integers $$$a \\neq b$$$. As an answer to this query you will get $$$\\gcd(x + a, x + b)$$$, where $$$\\gcd(n, m)$$$ is the greatest common divisor of the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. To guess one hidden number $$$x$$$ you are allowed to make no more than $$$30$$$ queries.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) denoting the number of test cases. The integer $$$x$$$ that you have to guess satisfies the constraints: ($$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$).",
