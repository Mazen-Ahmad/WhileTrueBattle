  "statement": "A string $$$a=a_1a_2\\dots a_n$$$ is called even if it consists of a concatenation (joining) of strings of length $$$2$$$ consisting of the same characters. In other words, a string $$$a$$$ is even if two conditions are satisfied at the same time : its length $$$n$$$ is even; for all odd $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n - 1$$$), $$$a_i = a_{i+1}$$$ is satisfied. For example, the following strings are even: \" \" (empty string), \" tt \", \" aabb \", \" oooo \", and \" ttrrrroouuuuuuuukk \". The following strings are not even: \" aaa \", \" abab \" and \" abba \". Given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Find the minimum number of characters to remove from the string $$$s$$$ to make it even. The deleted characters do not have to be consecutive.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) —the number of test cases in the test. The descriptions of the test cases follow. Each test case consists of one string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$|s|$$$ — the length of the string $$$s$$$. The string consists of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ on all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single number — the minimum number of characters that must be removed to make $$$s$$$ even.",
