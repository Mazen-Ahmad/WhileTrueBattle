  "statement": "You have a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, each element of which is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$, and a sequence $$$b$$$, which is initially empty. You are going to perform $$$n$$$ operations. On each of them you will increase the length of $$$b$$$ by $$$1$$$. On the $$$i$$$-th operation you choose an integer $$$p$$$ between $$$0$$$ and $$$i-1$$$. You insert $$$0$$$ in the sequence $$$b$$$ on position $$$p+1$$$ (after the first $$$p$$$ elements), and then you invert the first $$$p$$$ elements of $$$b$$$. More formally: let's denote the sequence $$$b$$$ before the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) operation as $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{i-1}$$$. On the $$$i$$$-th operation you choose an integer $$$p$$$ between $$$0$$$ and $$$i-1$$$ and replace $$$b$$$ with $$$\\overline{b_1}, \\overline{b_2}, \\ldots, \\overline{b_{p}}, 0, b_{p+1}, b_{p+2}, \\ldots, b_{i-1}$$$. Here, $$$\\overline{x}$$$ denotes the binary inversion. Hence, $$$\\overline{0} = 1$$$ and $$$\\overline{1} = 0$$$. You can find examples of operations in the Notes section. Determine if there exists a sequence of operations that makes $$$b$$$ equal to $$$a$$$. If such sequence of operations exists, find it.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 1$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case: output \" NO \", if it is impossible to make $$$b$$$ equal to $$$a$$$ using the given operations; otherwise, output \" YES \" in the first line and $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le p_i \\le i-1$$$) in the second line — the description of sequence of operations that makes $$$b$$$ equal to $$$a$$$. Here, $$$p_i$$$ should be the integer you choose on the $$$i$$$-th operation. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.",
