  "statement": "There is an infinite set generated as follows: $$$1$$$ is in this set. If $$$x$$$ is in this set, $$$x \\cdot a$$$ and $$$x+b$$$ both are in this set. For example, when $$$a=3$$$ and $$$b=6$$$, the five smallest elements of the set are: $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ ($$$1$$$ is in this set, so $$$1\\cdot a=3$$$ is in this set), $$$7$$$ ($$$1$$$ is in this set, so $$$1+b=7$$$ is in this set), $$$9$$$ ($$$3$$$ is in this set, so $$$3\\cdot a=9$$$ is in this set), $$$13$$$ ($$$7$$$ is in this set, so $$$7+b=13$$$ is in this set). Given positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$n$$$, determine if $$$n$$$ is in this set.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line describing each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$1\\leq n,a,b\\leq 10^9$$$) separated by a single space.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" Yes \" if $$$n$$$ is in this set, and \" No \" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.",
