  "statement": "A multiset is a set of numbers in which there can be equal elements, and the order of the numbers does not matter. For example, $$$\\{2,2,4\\}$$$ is a multiset. You have a multiset $$$S$$$. Initially, the multiset contains only one positive integer $$$n$$$. That is, $$$S=\\{n\\}$$$. Additionally, there is a given positive integer $$$k$$$. In one operation, you can select any positive integer $$$u$$$ in $$$S$$$ and remove one copy of $$$u$$$ from $$$S$$$. Then, insert no more than $$$k$$$ positive integers into $$$S$$$ so that the sum of all inserted integers is equal to $$$u$$$. Find the minimum number of operations to make $$$S$$$ contain $$$n$$$ ones.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The only line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n,k$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 1000,2\\le k\\le 1000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print one integer, which is the required answer.",
