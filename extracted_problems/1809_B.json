  "statement": "You are given a two-dimensional plane, and you need to place $$$n$$$ chips on it. You can place a chip only at a point with integer coordinates. The cost of placing a chip at the point $$$(x, y)$$$ is equal to $$$|x| + |y|$$$ (where $$$|a|$$$ is the absolute value of $$$a$$$). The cost of placing $$$n$$$ chips is equal to the maximum among the costs of each chip. You need to place $$$n$$$ chips on the plane in such a way that the Euclidean distance between each pair of chips is strictly greater than $$$1$$$, and the cost is the minimum possible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Next $$$t$$$ cases follow. The first and only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of chips you need to place.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum cost to place $$$n$$$ chips if the distance between each pair of chips must be strictly greater than $$$1$$$.",
