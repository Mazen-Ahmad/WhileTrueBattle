  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. The array is sorted if $$$a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\dots \\le a_n$$$. You want to make the array $$$a$$$ sorted by applying the following operation exactly once : choose an integer $$$x$$$, then for every $$$i \\in [1, n]$$$, replace $$$a_i$$$ by $$$|a_i - x|$$$. Find any value of $$$x$$$ that will make the array sorted, or report that there is no such value.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^8$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print any integer $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$) that makes the array sorted. It can be shown that if such an integer $$$x$$$ exists, there is at least one such integer between $$$0$$$ and $$$10^9$$$. If there is no such integer, then print $$$-1$$$. If there are multiple suitable values of $$$x$$$, print any of them.",
