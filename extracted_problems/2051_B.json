  "statement": "Monocarp decided to embark on a long hiking journey. He decided that on the first day he would walk $$$a$$$ kilometers, on the second day he would walk $$$b$$$ kilometers, on the third day he would walk $$$c$$$ kilometers, on the fourth day, just like on the first, he would walk $$$a$$$ kilometers, on the fifth day, just like on the second, he would walk $$$b$$$ kilometers, on the sixth day, just like on the third, he would walk $$$c$$$ kilometers, and so on. Monocarp will complete his journey on the day when he has walked at least $$$n$$$ kilometers in total. Your task is to determine the day on which Monocarp will complete his journey.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing four integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\le a, b, c \\le 10^6$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the day on which Monocarp will have walked at least $$$n$$$ kilometers in total and will complete his journey.",
