  "statement": "The Master's Assistance Center has announced an entrance exam, which consists of the following. The candidate is given a set $$$s$$$ of size $$$n$$$ and some strange integer $$$c$$$. For this set, it is needed to calculate the number of pairs of integers $$$(x, y)$$$ such that $$$0 \\leq x \\leq y \\leq c$$$, $$$x + y$$$ is not contained in the set $$$s$$$, and also $$$y - x$$$ is not contained in the set $$$s$$$. Your friend wants to enter the Center. Help him pass the exam!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq c \\leq 10^9$$$) — the size of the set and the strange integer. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{n}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq s_1 < s_2 < \\ldots < s_{n} \\leq c$$$) — the elements of the set $$$s$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of suitable pairs of integers.",
