  "statement": "You are given an integer array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. The elements of the array are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose an index $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$; decrease $$$a_i$$$ by $$$2$$$ and increase $$$a_{(i \\bmod n) + 1}$$$ by $$$1$$$. After you perform the operations, all elements of the array should be non-negative equal integers . Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of operations you have to perform. If it is impossible to make all elements of the array equal, print -1 .",
