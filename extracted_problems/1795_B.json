  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ one-dimensional segments (each segment is denoted by two integers — its endpoints). Let's define the function $$$f(x)$$$ as the number of segments covering point $$$x$$$ (a segment covers the point $$$x$$$ if $$$l \\le x \\le r$$$, where $$$l$$$ is the left endpoint and $$$r$$$ is the right endpoint of the segment). An integer point $$$x$$$ is called ideal if it belongs to more segments than any other integer point, i. e. $$$f(y) < f(x)$$$ is true for any other integer point $$$y$$$. You are given an integer $$$k$$$. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to remove some (possibly zero) segments, so that the given point $$$k$$$ becomes ideal .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 50$$$). Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, $$$i$$$-th line of them contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i, r_i \\le 50$$$; $$$l_i \\le r_i$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th segment.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if it is possible to remove some (possibly zero) segments, so that the given point $$$k$$$ becomes ideal , otherwise print NO . You may print each letter in any case ( YES , yes , Yes will all be recognized as positive answer, NO , no and nO will all be recognized as negative answer).",
