  "statement": "You are given a list of $$$n$$$ integers. You can perform the following operation: you choose an element $$$x$$$ from the list, erase $$$x$$$ from the list, and subtract the value of $$$x$$$ from all the remaining elements. Thus, in one operation, the length of the list is decreased by exactly $$$1$$$. Given an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k>0$$$), find if there is some sequence of $$$n-1$$$ operations such that, after applying the operations, the only remaining element of the list is equal to $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$), the number of integers in the list, and the target value, respectively. The second line of each test case contains the $$$n$$$ integers of the list $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is not greater that $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if you can achieve $$$k$$$ with a sequence of $$$n-1$$$ operations. Otherwise, print NO . You may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as a positive answer).",
