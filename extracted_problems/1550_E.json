  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Each character is either one of the first $$$k$$$ lowercase Latin letters or a question mark. You are asked to replace every question mark with one of the first $$$k$$$ lowercase Latin letters in such a way that the following value is maximized. Let $$$f_i$$$ be the maximum length substring of string $$$s$$$, which consists entirely of the $$$i$$$-th Latin letter. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. If the $$$i$$$-th letter doesn't appear in a string, then $$$f_i$$$ is equal to $$$0$$$. The value of a string $$$s$$$ is the minimum value among $$$f_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$. What is the maximum value the string can have?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 17$$$) — the length of the string and the number of first Latin letters used. The second line contains a string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ characters. Each character is either one of the first $$$k$$$ lowercase Latin letters or a question mark.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer — the maximum value of the string after every question mark is replaced with one of the first $$$k$$$ lowercase Latin letters.",
