  "statement": "Once the mischievous and wayward shooter named Shel found himself on a rectangular field of size $$$n \\times m$$$, divided into unit squares. Each cell either contains a target or not. Shel only had a lucky shotgun with him, with which he can shoot in one of the four directions: right-down, left-down, left-up, or right-up. When fired, the shotgun hits all targets in the chosen direction, the Manhattan distance to which does not exceed a fixed constant $$$k$$$. The Manhattan distance between two points $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ is equal to $$$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$$$. Possible hit areas for $$$k = 3$$$. Shel's goal is to hit as many targets as possible. Please help him find this value.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains field dimensions $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and the constant for the shotgun's power $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m, k \\le 10^5, 1 \\le n \\cdot m \\le 10^5$$$). Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ characters — the description of the next field row, where the character ' . ' means the cell is empty, and the character ' # ' indicates the presence of a target. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line, which is equal to the maximum possible number of hit targets with one shot.",
