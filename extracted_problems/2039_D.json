  "statement": "Shohag has an integer $$$n$$$ and a set $$$S$$$ of $$$m$$$ unique integers. Help him find the lexicographically largest$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ such that $$$a_i \\in S$$$ for each $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ and $$$a_{\\operatorname{gcd}(i, j)} \\neq \\operatorname{gcd}(a_i, a_j)$$$$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ is satisfied over all pairs $$$1 \\le i \\lt j \\le n$$$, or state that no such array exists. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$a$$$ is lexicographically larger than an array $$$b$$$ of the same length if $$$a \\ne b$$$, and in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the array $$$a$$$ has a larger element than the corresponding element in $$$b$$$. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$$$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$m$$$ unique integers in increasing order, representing the elements of the set $$$S$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le n$$$ for each $$$x \\in S$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no solution print $$$-1$$$, otherwise print $$$n$$$ integers — the lexicographically largest integer array that satisfies the conditions.",
