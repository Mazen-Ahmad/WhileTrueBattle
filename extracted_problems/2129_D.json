  "statement": "For a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, the corresponding coloring sequence $$$s$$$ can be obtained by the following coloring process: Initially, there are $$$n$$$ white cells indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. At second $$$0$$$, the score of each cell is $$$0$$$. At second $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$), If $$$i > 1$$$, find the nearest black cell to the cell $$$p_i$$$, and increase the score of that cell by $$$1$$$. In case there are multiple nearest black cells, choose the cell with the lowest index. Cell $$$y$$$ is called the nearest black cell to cell $$$x$$$ only if cell $$$y$$$ is black and there is no black cell $$$z$$$ satisfying $$$|x-z|<|x-y|$$$. Color the cell $$$p_i$$$ black. After all cells are colored black, denoting $$$s_i$$$ as the score of cell $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$), we get the coloring sequence $$$s$$$. You might want to read the notes for a better understanding. You are given an incomplete coloring sequence $$$s$$$, where some $$$s_i$$$ are already fixed, while others are not yet determined. Count how many different permutations $$$p$$$ can produce this coloring sequence. Since the answer may be large, you need to output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows. For each test case, the first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$ ($$$-1 \\leq s_i \\leq n-1$$$). Here, $$$s_i=-1$$$ means $$$s_i$$$ has not been determined. And $$$s_i \\neq -1$$$ means $$$s_i$$$ has already been fixed. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the total of different permutations $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ that can produce the coloring sequence, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
