  "statement": "Ecrade has an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. It's guaranteed that for each $$$1 \\le i < n$$$, $$$a_i \\neq a_{i+1}$$$. Ecrade can perform several operations on the array to make it strictly increasing. In each operation, he can choose two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) and replace $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ with any $$$r-l+1$$$ integers $$$a'_l, a'_{l+1}, \\ldots, a'_r$$$ satisfying the following constraint: For each $$$l \\le i < r$$$, the comparison between $$$a'_i$$$ and $$$a'_{i+1}$$$ is the same as that between $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$, i.e., if $$$a_i < a_{i + 1}$$$, then $$$a'_i < a'_{i + 1}$$$; otherwise, if $$$a_i > a_{i + 1}$$$, then $$$a'_i > a'_{i + 1}$$$; otherwise, if $$$a_i = a_{i + 1}$$$, then $$$a'_i = a'_{i + 1}$$$. Ecrade wants to know the minimum number of operations to make the array strictly increasing. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that for each $$$1 \\le i< n$$$, $$$a_i \\neq a_{i+1}$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
