  "statement": "The famous magician Borya Budini traveled through the country $$$X$$$, which consists of $$$n$$$ cities. However, an accident happened, and he was robbed in the city number $$$1$$$. Now Budini will have a hard way home to the city number $$$n$$$. He's going to get there by plane. In total, there are $$$m$$$ flights in the country, $$$i$$$-th flies from city $$$a_i$$$ to city $$$b_i$$$ and costs $$$s_i$$$ coins. Note that the $$$i$$$-th flight is one-way, so it can't be used to get from city $$$b_i$$$ to city $$$a_i$$$. To use it, Borya must be in the city $$$a_i$$$ and have at least $$$s_i$$$ coins (which he will spend on the flight). After the robbery, he has only $$$p$$$ coins left, but he does not despair! Being in the city $$$i$$$, he can organize performances every day, each performance will bring him $$$w_i$$$ coins. Help the magician find out if he will be able to get home, and what is the minimum number of performances he will have to organize.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 80$$$) – the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$p$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 800$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 3000$$$, $$$0 \\le p \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of cities, the number of flights and the initial amount of coins. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n$$$ $$$(1 \\le w_i \\le 10^9)$$$ — profit from representations. The following $$$m$$$ lines each contain three integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ and $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le s_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the starting and ending city, and the cost of $$$i$$$-th flight. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$800$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of performances Borya will have to organize to get home, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to do this.",
