  "statement": "eliteLAQ - Desert Ruins ⠀ There are $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ on a blackboard. You are also given a positive integer $$$k$$$. You can perform the following operation some (possibly $$$0$$$) times: choose a number $$$x$$$ on the blackboard; erase one occurrence of $$$x$$$; write two positive integers $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$ such that $$$y+z = x+k$$$ on the blackboard. Is it possible to make all the numbers on the blackboard equal? If yes, what is the minimum number of operations you need?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^{12}$$$) — the number of integers initially on the blackboard and the constant $$$k$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{12}$$$) — the initial state of the blackboard. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the minimum number of operations you need to make all the numbers on the blackboard equal, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.",
