  "statement": "You are given a tree with $$$n$$$ nodes. As a reminder, a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. Let $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ be a sequence of integers. Perform the following operation exactly $$$n$$$ times: Select an unerased node $$$u$$$. Assign $$$a_u :=$$$ number of unerased nodes adjacent to $$$u$$$. Then, erase the node $$$u$$$ along with all edges that have it as an endpoint. For each integer $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, find the number, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$, of different sequences $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ that satisfy the following conditions: it is possible to obtain $$$a$$$ by performing the aforementioned operations exactly $$$n$$$ times in some order. $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) = k$$$. Here, $$$\\operatorname{gcd}$$$ means the greatest common divisor of the elements in $$$a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$) indicating there is an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers in a single line, where for each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the $$$k$$$-th integer denotes the answer when $$$\\operatorname{gcd}$$$ equals to $$$k$$$.",
