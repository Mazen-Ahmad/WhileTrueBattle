  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of positive integers. A good pair is a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ with $$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$ such that, for all $$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$, the following equality holds: $$$$$$ |a_i - a_k| + |a_k - a_j| = |a_i - a_j|, $$$$$$ where $$$|x|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$x$$$. Find a good pair. Note that $$$i$$$ can be equal to $$$j$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of the array. The sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases is at most $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line with two space-separated indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ which form a good pair of the array. The case $$$i=j$$$ is allowed. It can be shown that such a pair always exists. If there are multiple good pairs, print any of them.",
