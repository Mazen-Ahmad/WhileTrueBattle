  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters a and/or b . Let $$$\\operatorname{AB}(s)$$$ be the number of occurrences of string ab in $$$s$$$ as a substring . Analogically, $$$\\operatorname{BA}(s)$$$ is the number of occurrences of ba in $$$s$$$ as a substring . In one step, you can choose any index $$$i$$$ and replace $$$s_i$$$ with character a or b . What is the minimum number of steps you need to make to achieve $$$\\operatorname{AB}(s) = \\operatorname{BA}(s)$$$? Reminder: The number of occurrences of string $$$d$$$ in $$$s$$$ as substring is the number of indices $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |s| - |d| + 1$$$) such that substring $$$s_i s_{i + 1} \\dots s_{i + |d| - 1}$$$ is equal to $$$d$$$. For example, $$$\\operatorname{AB}($$$ aabbbabaa $$$) = 2$$$ since there are two indices $$$i$$$: $$$i = 2$$$ where a ab bbabaa and $$$i = 6$$$ where aabbb ab aa .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 100$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$), consisting only of characters a and/or b .",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the resulting string $$$s$$$ with $$$\\operatorname{AB}(s) = \\operatorname{BA}(s)$$$ you'll get making the minimum number of steps. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
