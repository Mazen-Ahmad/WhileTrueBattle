  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of positive integers . You can perform the following operation on this array any number of times (possibly zero): choose three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ and $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, and multiply every $$$a_i$$$ such that $$$l \\le i \\le r$$$ by $$$x$$$. Note that you can choose any integer as $$$x$$$, it doesn't have to be positive. You have to calculate the minimum number of operations to make the array $$$a$$$ sorted in strictly ascending order (i. e. the condition $$$a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < a_n$$$ must be satisfied).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ sorted in strictly ascending order.",
