  "statement": "You are given an initially empty undirected graph with $$$n$$$ nodes, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (i. e. $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$0$$$ edges). You want to add $$$m$$$ edges to the graph, so the graph won't contain any self-loop or multiple edges. If an edge connecting two nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ is added, its weight must be equal to the greatest common divisor of $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, i. e. $$$\\gcd(u, v)$$$. In order to add edges to the graph, you can repeat the following process any number of times (possibly zero): choose an integer $$$k \\ge 1$$$; add exactly $$$k$$$ edges to the graph, each having a weight equal to $$$k + 1$$$. Adding these $$$k$$$ edges costs $$$k + 1$$$ in total. Note that you can't create self-loops or multiple edges. Also, if you can't add $$$k$$$ edges of weight $$$k + 1$$$, you can't choose such $$$k$$$. For example, if you can add $$$5$$$ more edges to the graph of weight $$$6$$$, you may add them, and it will cost $$$6$$$ for the whole pack of $$$5$$$ edges. But if you can only add $$$4$$$ edges of weight $$$6$$$ to the graph, you can't perform this operation for $$$k = 5$$$. Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, find the minimum total cost to form a graph of $$$n$$$ vertices and exactly $$$m$$$ edges using the operation above. If such a graph can't be constructed, output $$$-1$$$. Note that the final graph may consist of several connected components.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^6$$$; $$$1 \\leq m \\leq \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the minimum cost to build the graph, or $$$-1$$$ if you can't build such a graph.",
