  "statement": "This is an interactive problem! In the new round, there were $$$n$$$ tasks with difficulties from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The coordinator, who decided to have the first round with tasks in unsorted order of difficulty, rearranged the tasks, resulting in a permutation of difficulties from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. After that, the coordinator challenged ace5 to guess the permutation in the following way. Initially, the coordinator chooses a number $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. ace5 can make queries of the form: $$$?\\ i$$$. The answer will be: $$$>$$$, if $$$a_i > x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ increases by $$$1$$$. $$$<$$$, if $$$a_i < x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ decreases by $$$1$$$. $$$=$$$, if $$$a_i = x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ remains unchanged. The task for ace5 is to guess the permutation in no more than $$$40n$$$ queries. Since ace5 is too busy writing the announcement, he has entrusted this task to you.",
