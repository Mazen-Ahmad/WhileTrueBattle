  "statement": "You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ each consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. All elements of $$$a$$$ are pairwise distinct. Find the number of ways to reorder $$$a$$$ such that $$$a_i > b_i$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. Two ways of reordering are considered different if the resulting arrays are different.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that all elements of $$$a$$$ are pairwise distinct. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1$$$, $$$b_2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the number of ways to reorder array $$$a$$$ such that $$$a_i > b_i$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
