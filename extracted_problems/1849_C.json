  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters 0 and/or 1 . You make $$$m$$$ copies of this string, let the $$$i$$$-th copy be the string $$$t_i$$$. Then you perform exactly one operation on each of the copies: for the $$$i$$$-th copy, you sort its substring $$$[l_i; r_i]$$$ (the substring from the $$$l_i$$$-th character to the $$$r_i$$$-th character, both endpoints inclusive). Note that each operation affects only one copy, and each copy is affected by only one operation . Your task is to calculate the number of different strings among $$$t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_m$$$. Note that the initial string $$$s$$$ should be counted only if at least one of the copies stays the same after the operation.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$s$$$ and the number of copies, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ characters 0 and/or 1 — the string $$$s$$$. Then $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$) — the description of the operation applied to the $$$i$$$-th copy. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. The sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
