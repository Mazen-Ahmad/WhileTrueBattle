  "statement": "You have obtained the new limited event character Xilonen. You decide to use her in combat. There are $$$n$$$ enemies in a line. The $$$i$$$'th enemy from the left has health $$$h_i$$$ and is currently at position $$$x_i$$$. Xilonen has an attack damage of $$$m$$$, and you are ready to defeat the enemies with her. Xilonen has a powerful \"ground stomp\" attack. Before you perform any attacks , you select an integer $$$p$$$ and position Xilonen there ($$$p$$$ can be any integer position, including a position with an enemy currently). Afterwards, for each attack, she deals $$$m$$$ damage to an enemy at position $$$p$$$ (if there are any), $$$m-1$$$ damage to enemies at positions $$$p-1$$$ and $$$p+1$$$, $$$m-2$$$ damage to enemies at positions $$$p-2$$$ and $$$p+2$$$, and so on. Enemies that are at least a distance of $$$m$$$ away from Xilonen take no damage from attacks. Formally, if there is an enemy at position $$$x$$$, she will deal $$$\\max(0,m - |p - x|)$$$ damage to that enemy each hit. Note that you may not choose a different $$$p$$$ for different attacks. Over all possible $$$p$$$, output the minimum number of attacks Xilonen must perform to defeat at least $$$k$$$ enemies. If it is impossible to find a $$$p$$$ such that eventually at least $$$k$$$ enemies will be defeated, output $$$-1$$$ instead. Note that an enemy is considered to be defeated if its health reaches $$$0$$$ or below.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) â€“ the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9$$$). The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, ..., h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq h_i \\leq 10^9$$$). The last line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq x_i \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$x_i < x_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i < n$$$) It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output an integer on a new line, the minimum number of attacks that must be performed to defeat at least $$$k$$$ enemies. If it is impossible to find a $$$p$$$ such that eventually at least $$$k$$$ enemies will be defeated, output $$$-1$$$ instead.",
