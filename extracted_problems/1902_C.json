  "statement": "You are given an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, all its elements are distinct. First, you are asked to insert one more integer $$$a_{n+1}$$$ into this array. $$$a_{n+1}$$$ should not be equal to any of $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. Then, you will have to make all elements of the array equal. At the start, you choose a positive integer $$$x$$$ ($$$x > 0$$$). In one operation, you add $$$x$$$ to exactly one element of the array. Note that $$$x$$$ is the same for all operations . What's the smallest number of operations it can take you to make all elements equal, after you choose $$$a_{n+1}$$$ and $$$x$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). All $$$a_i$$$ are distinct. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print a single integer — the smallest number of operations it can take you to make all elements equal, after you choose integers $$$a_{n+1}$$$ and $$$x$$$.",
