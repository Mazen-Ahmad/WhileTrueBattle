  "statement": "Ivan decided to prepare for the test on solving integer equations. He noticed that all tasks in the test have the following form: You are given two positive integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, find any pair of integers ( not necessarily positive ) $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, such that: $$$$$$\\frac{x}{u} + \\frac{y}{v} = \\frac{x + y}{u + v}.$$$$$$ The solution $$$x = 0$$$, $$$y = 0$$$ is forbidden, so you should find any solution with $$$(x, y) \\neq (0, 0)$$$. Please help Ivan to solve some equations of this form.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq 10^9$$$) — the parameters of the equation.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print two integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ — a possible solution to the equation. It should be satisfied that $$$-10^{18} \\leq x, y \\leq 10^{18}$$$ and $$$(x, y) \\neq (0, 0)$$$. We can show that an answer always exists. If there are multiple possible solutions you can print any.",
