  "statement": "Tina has a square grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. Each cell in the grid is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. Tina wants to reduce the grid by a factor of $$$k$$$ ( $$$k$$$ is a divisor of $$$n$$$ ). To do this, Tina splits the grid into $$$k \\times k$$$ nonoverlapping blocks of cells such that every cell belongs to exactly one block. Tina then replaces each block of cells with a single cell equal to the value of the cells in the block. It is guaranteed that every cell in the same block has the same value . For example, the following demonstration shows a grid being reduced by factor of $$$3$$$. Original grid $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ Reduced grid $$$0$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$0$$$ Help Tina reduce the grid by a factor of $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) – the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$, $$$k$$$ is a divisor of $$$n$$$ ) — the number of rows and columns of the grid, and the factor that Tina wants to reduce the grid by. Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ characters describing the cells of the grid. Each character is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. It is guaranteed every $$$k$$$ by $$$k$$$ block has the same value. It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the grid reduced by a factor of $$$k$$$ on a new line.",
