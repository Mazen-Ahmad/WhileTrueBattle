  "statement": "You are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$. You want to minimize the number of subarrays of $$$p$$$ that are permutations. In order to do so, you must perform the following operation exactly once: Select integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, where $$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, then Swap $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$. For example, if $$$p = [5, 1, 4, 2, 3]$$$ and we choose $$$i = 2$$$, $$$j = 3$$$, the resulting array will be $$$[5, 4, 1, 2, 3]$$$. If instead we choose $$$i = j = 5$$$, the resulting array will be $$$[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]$$$. Which choice of $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ will minimize the number of subarrays that are permutations? A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). An array $$$a$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the permutation. The next line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) — the elements of the permutation $$$p$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$) — the indices to swap in $$$p$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
