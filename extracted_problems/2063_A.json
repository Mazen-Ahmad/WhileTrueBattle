  "statement": "Today, Little John used all his savings to buy a segment. He wants to build a house on this segment. A segment of positive integers $$$[l,r]$$$ is called coprime if $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ are coprime$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. A coprime segment $$$[l,r]$$$ is called minimal coprime if it does not contain$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ any coprime segment not equal to itself. To better understand this statement, you can refer to the notes. Given $$$[l,r]$$$, a segment of positive integers, find the number of minimal coprime segments contained in $$$[l,r]$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$Two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are coprime if they share only one positive common divisor. For example, the numbers $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ are not coprime because they are both divided by $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$, but the numbers $$$7$$$ and $$$9$$$ are coprime because their only positive common divisor is $$$1$$$. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A segment $$$[l',r']$$$ is contained in the segment $$$[l,r]$$$ if and only if $$$l \\le l' \\le r' \\le r$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case consists of two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the number of minimal coprime segments contained in $$$[l,r]$$$, on a separate line.",
