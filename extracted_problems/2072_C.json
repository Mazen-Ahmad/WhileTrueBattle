  "statement": "Akito still has nowhere to live, and the price for a small room is everywhere. For this reason, Akito decided to get a job at a bank as a key creator for storages. In this magical world, everything is different. For example, the key for a storage with the code $$$(n, x)$$$ is an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that: $$$a_1 \\ | \\ a_2 \\ | \\ a_3 \\ | \\ \\ldots \\ | \\ a_n = x$$$, where $$$a \\ | \\ b$$$ is the bitwise \"OR\" of numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. $$$\\text{MEX}(\\{ a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n \\})$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ is maximized among all such arrays. Akito diligently performed his job for several hours, but suddenly he got a headache. Substitute for him for an hour; for the given $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$, create any key for the storage with the code $$$(n, x)$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$\\text{MEX}(S)$$$ is the minimum non-negative integer $$$z$$$ such that $$$z$$$ is not contained in the set $$$S$$$ and all $$$0 \\le y < z$$$ are contained in $$$S$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. In the only line of each test case, two numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, 0 \\le x < 2^{30}$$$) are given — the length of the array and the desired value of the bitwise \"OR\". It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < 2^{30}$$$) — the elements of the key array that satisfy all the conditions. If there are multiple suitable arrays, output any of them.",
