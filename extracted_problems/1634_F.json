  "statement": "One of my most productive days was throwing away 1,000 lines of code. — Ken Thompson Fibonacci addition is an operation on an array $$$X$$$ of integers, parametrized by indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. Fibonacci addition increases $$$X_l$$$ by $$$F_1$$$, increases $$$X_{l + 1}$$$ by $$$F_2$$$, and so on up to $$$X_r$$$ which is increased by $$$F_{r - l + 1}$$$. $$$F_i$$$ denotes the $$$i$$$-th Fibonacci number ($$$F_1 = 1$$$, $$$F_2 = 1$$$, $$$F_{i} = F_{i - 1} + F_{i - 2}$$$ for $$$i > 2$$$), and all operations are performed modulo $$$MOD$$$ . You are given two arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ of the same length. We will ask you to perform several Fibonacci additions on these arrays with different parameters, and after each operation you have to report whether arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are equal modulo $$$MOD$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains 3 numbers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ and $$$MOD$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 3\\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le MOD \\le 10^9+7$$$) — the length of the arrays, the number of operations, and the number modulo which all operations are performed. The second line contains $$$n$$$ numbers — array $$$A$$$ ($$$0 \\le A_i < MOD$$$). The third line also contains $$$n$$$ numbers — array $$$B$$$ ($$$0 \\le B_i < MOD$$$). The next $$$q$$$ lines contain character $$$c$$$ and two numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) — operation parameters. If $$$c$$$ is \"A\", Fibonacci addition is to be performed on array $$$A$$$, and if it is is \"B\", the operation is to be performed on $$$B$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "After each operation, print \"YES\" (without quotes) if the arrays are equal and \"NO\" otherwise. Letter case does not matter.",
