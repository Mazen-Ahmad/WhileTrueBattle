  "statement": "Now you get Baby Ehab's first words: \"Given an integer $$$n$$$, find the longest subsequence of $$$[1,2, \\ldots, n-1]$$$ whose product is $$$1$$$ modulo $$$n$$$.\" Please solve the problem. A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by deleting some (possibly all) elements. The product of an empty subsequence is equal to $$$1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The only line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "The first line should contain a single integer, the length of the longest subsequence. The second line should contain the elements of the subsequence, in increasing order . If there are multiple solutions, you can print any.",
