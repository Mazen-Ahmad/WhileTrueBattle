  "statement": "A compass points directly toward the morning star. It can only point in one of eight directions: the four cardinal directions (N, S, E, W) or some combination (NW, NE, SW, SE). Otherwise, it will break. The directions the compass can point. There are $$$n$$$ distinct points with integer coordinates on a plane. How many ways can you put a compass at one point and the morning star at another so that the compass does not break?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of points. Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, each line containing two integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of each point, all points have distinct coordinates. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of pairs of points that don't break the compass.",
