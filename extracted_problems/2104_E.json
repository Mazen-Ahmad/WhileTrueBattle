  "statement": "Let's call a letter allowed if it is a lowercase letter and is one of the first $$$k$$$ letters of the Latin alphabet. You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of allowed letters. Let's call a string $$$t$$$ pleasant if $$$t$$$ is a subsequence of $$$s$$$. You are given $$$q$$$ strings $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_q$$$. All of them consist only of allowed letters. For each string $$$t_i$$$, calculate the minimum number of allowed letters you need to append to it on the right so that it stops being pleasant. A sequence $$$t$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$s$$$ if $$$t$$$ can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 26$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$ and the number of allowed letters. The second line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters. Each character of the string is one of the first $$$k$$$ letters of the Latin alphabet. The third line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. The next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries: one query per line. The $$$i$$$-th line contains the string $$$t_i$$$, consisting only of allowed letters. Additional constraint on input: the total length of all $$$t_i$$$ does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, output one integer — the minimum number of allowed letters that need to be appended to the string on the right so that it stops being pleasant.",
