  "statement": "Alice has just learned addition. However, she hasn't learned the concept of \"carrying\" fully — instead of carrying to the next column, she carries to the column two columns to the left . For example, the regular way to evaluate the sum $$$2039 + 2976$$$ would be as shown: However, Alice evaluates it as shown: In particular, this is what she does: add $$$9$$$ and $$$6$$$ to make $$$15$$$, and carry the $$$1$$$ to the column two columns to the left , i. e. to the column \"$$$0$$$ $$$9$$$\"; add $$$3$$$ and $$$7$$$ to make $$$10$$$ and carry the $$$1$$$ to the column two columns to the left , i. e. to the column \"$$$2$$$ $$$2$$$\"; add $$$1$$$, $$$0$$$, and $$$9$$$ to make $$$10$$$ and carry the $$$1$$$ to the column two columns to the left , i. e. to the column above the plus sign; add $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ to make $$$5$$$; add $$$1$$$ to make $$$1$$$. Thus, she ends up with the incorrect result of $$$15005$$$. Alice comes up to Bob and says that she has added two numbers to get a result of $$$n$$$. However, Bob knows that Alice adds in her own way. Help Bob find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers such that when Alice adds them, she will get a result of $$$n$$$. Note that pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ and $$$(b, a)$$$ are considered different if $$$a \\ne b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number Alice shows Bob.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the number of ordered pairs of positive integers such that when Alice adds them, she will get a result of $$$n$$$.",
