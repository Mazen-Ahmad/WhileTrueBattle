  "statement": "You have a rectangular board of size $$$n\\times m$$$ ($$$n$$$ rows, $$$m$$$ columns). The $$$n$$$ rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom, and the $$$m$$$ columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. The cell at the intersection of row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ contains the number $$$i^j$$$ ($$$i$$$ raised to the power of $$$j$$$). For example, if $$$n=3$$$ and $$$m=3$$$ the board is as follows: Find the number of distinct integers written on the board.",
  "inputFormat": "The only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\le n,m\\le 10^6$$$) â€” the number of rows and columns of the board.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer, the number of distinct integers on the board.",
