  "statement": "Li Hua has a tree of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n-1$$$ edges. The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. A pair of vertices $$$(u,v)$$$ ($$$u < v$$$) is considered cute if exactly one of the following two statements is true: $$$u$$$ is the vertex with the minimum index among all vertices on the path $$$(u,v)$$$. $$$v$$$ is the vertex with the maximum index among all vertices on the path $$$(u,v)$$$. There will be $$$m$$$ operations. In each operation, he decides an integer $$$k_j$$$, then inserts a vertex numbered $$$n+j$$$ to the tree, connecting with the vertex numbered $$$k_j$$$. He wants to calculate the number of cute pairs before operations and after each operation. Suppose you were Li Hua, please solve this problem.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree. Next $$$n-1$$$ lines contain the edges of the tree. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1\\le u_i,v_i\\le n$$$; $$$u_i\\ne v_i$$$) — the corresponding edge. The given edges form a tree. The next line contains the single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\le m\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of operations. Next $$$m$$$ lines contain operations — one operation per line. The $$$j$$$-th operation contains one integer $$$k_j$$$ ($$$1\\le k_j < n+j$$$) — a vertex.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$m+1$$$ integers — the number of cute pairs before operations and after each operation.",
