  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. This is the game version of the problem. Note that the solution of this problem may or may not share ideas with the solution of the solo version. You can solve and get points for both versions independently. Alice and Bob are playing a game. The game starts with a positive integer $$$n$$$, with players taking turns. On each turn of the game, the following sequence of events takes place: The player having the integer $$$p$$$ breaks it into two integers $$$p_{1}$$$ and $$$p_{2}$$$, where $$$0 \\lt p_{1} \\lt p$$$, $$$0 \\lt p_{2} \\lt p$$$ and $$$p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} = p$$$. If no such $$$p_{1}$$$, $$$p_{2}$$$ exist, the player loses. Otherwise, the opponent does either select the integer $$$p_{1}$$$ or $$$p_{2}$$$. The game continues with the selected integer. The opponent will try to break it. As Alice, your goal is to win. You can execute a maximum of $$$63$$$ break operations. You have the choice to play first or second. The system will act for Bob. Here $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the number the game starts with.",
