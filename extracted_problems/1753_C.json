  "statement": "You are given a binary array $$$a$$$ (all elements of the array are $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$) of length $$$n$$$. You wish to sort this array, but unfortunately, your algorithms teacher forgot to teach you sorting algorithms. You perform the following operations until $$$a$$$ is sorted: Choose two random indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$. Indices are chosen equally probable among all pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$. If $$$a_i > a_j$$$, then swap elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$. What is the expected number of such operations you will perform before the array becomes sorted? It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{998\\,244\\,353}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod 998\\,244\\,353$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < 998\\,244\\,353$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{998\\,244\\,353}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 200\\,000$$$) — the number of elements in the binary array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$$$) — elements of the array. It's guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$200\\,000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print one integer — the value $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod 998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
