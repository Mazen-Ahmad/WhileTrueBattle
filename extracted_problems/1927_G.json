  "statement": "A horizontal grid strip of $$$n$$$ cells is given. In the $$$i$$$-th cell, there is a paint charge of size $$$a_i$$$. This charge can be: either used to the left — then all cells to the left at a distance less than $$$a_i$$$ (from $$$\\max(i - a_i + 1, 1)$$$ to $$$i$$$ inclusive) will be painted, or used to the right — then all cells to the right at a distance less than $$$a_i$$$ (from $$$i$$$ to $$$\\min(i + a_i - 1, n)$$$ inclusive) will be painted, or not used at all. Note that a charge can be used no more than once (that is, it cannot be used simultaneously to the left and to the right). It is allowed for a cell to be painted more than once. What is the minimum number of times a charge needs to be used to paint all the cells of the strip?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. This is followed by descriptions of $$$t$$$ test cases. Each test case is specified by two lines. The first one contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of cells in the strip. The second line contains $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the size of the paint charge in the $$$i$$$-th cell from the left of the strip. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ in the test does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum number of times the charges need to be used to paint all the cells of the strip.",
