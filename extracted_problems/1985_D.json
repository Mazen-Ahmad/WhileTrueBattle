  "statement": "Given a $$$n$$$ by $$$m$$$ grid consisting of '.' and '#' characters, there exists a whole manhattan circle on the grid. The top left corner of the grid has coordinates $$$(1,1)$$$, and the bottom right corner has coordinates $$$(n, m)$$$. Point ($$$a, b$$$) belongs to the manhattan circle centered at ($$$h, k$$$) if $$$|h - a| + |k - b| < r$$$, where $$$r$$$ is a positive constant. On the grid, the set of points that are part of the manhattan circle is marked as '#'. Find the coordinates of the center of the circle.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the height and width of the grid, respectively. The next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ characters '.' or '#'. If the character is '#', then the point is part of the manhattan circle. It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, and there is a whole manhattan circle on the grid.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the two integers, the coordinates of the center of the circle.",
