  "statement": "You are the author of a Codeforces round and have prepared $$$n$$$ problems you are going to set, problem $$$i$$$ having difficulty $$$a_i$$$. You will do the following process: remove some (possibly zero) problems from the list; rearrange the remaining problems in any order you wish. A round is considered balanced if and only if the absolute difference between the difficulty of any two consecutive problems is at most $$$k$$$ (less or equal than $$$k$$$). What is the minimum number of problems you have to remove so that an arrangement of problems is balanced?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two positive integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of problems, and the maximum allowed absolute difference between consecutive problems. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the difficulty of each problem. Note that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems you have to remove so that an arrangement of problems is balanced.",
