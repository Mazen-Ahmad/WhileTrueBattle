  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. You are asked to choose maximum number of distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ so that there is no subset of chosen numbers with sum equal to $$$k$$$. A subset of a set is a set that can be obtained from initial one by removing some (possibly all or none) elements of it.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the number of test cases $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\le T \\le 100$$$). Each of the next $$$T$$$ lines contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 1000$$$) — the description of test cases.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output two lines. In the first line output a single integer $$$m$$$ — the number of chosen integers. In the second line output $$$m$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ — the chosen numbers. If there are multiple answers, print any. You can print the numbers in any order.",
