  "statement": "Madoka finally found the administrator password for her computer. Her father is a well-known popularizer of mathematics, so the password is the answer to the following problem. Find the maximum decimal number without zeroes and with no equal digits in a row, such that the sum of its digits is $$$n$$$. Madoka is too tired of math to solve it herself, so help her to solve this problem!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$) — the required sum of the digits.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print the maximum number you can obtain.",
