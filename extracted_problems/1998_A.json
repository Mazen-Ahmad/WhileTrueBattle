  "statement": "I couldn't think of a good title for this problem, so I decided to learn from LeetCode. — Sun Tzu, The Art of War You are given three integers $$$x_c$$$, $$$y_c$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$-100 \\leq x_c, y_c \\leq 100$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 1000$$$). You need to find $$$k$$$ distinct points ($$$x_1, y_1$$$), ($$$x_2, y_2$$$), $$$\\ldots$$$, ($$$x_k, y_k$$$), having integer coordinates, on the 2D coordinate plane such that: their center$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ is ($$$x_c, y_c$$$) $$$-10^9 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^9$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ It can be proven that at least one set of $$$k$$$ distinct points always exists that satisfies these conditions. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The center of $$$k$$$ points ($$$x_1, y_1$$$), ($$$x_2, y_2$$$), $$$\\ldots$$$, ($$$x_k, y_k$$$) is $$$\\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_k}{k}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2 + \\ldots + y_k}{k} \\right)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains three integers $$$x_c$$$, $$$y_c$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$-100 \\leq x_c, y_c \\leq 100$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 1000$$$) — the coordinates of the center and the number of distinct points you must output. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$k$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th line containing two space separated integers, $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$, ($$$-10^9 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — denoting the position of the $$$i$$$-th point. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. It can be shown that a solution always exists under the given constraints.",
