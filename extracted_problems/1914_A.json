  "statement": "Monocarp is participating in a programming contest, which features $$$26$$$ problems, named from ' A ' to ' Z '. The problems are sorted by difficulty. Moreover, it's known that Monocarp can solve problem ' A ' in $$$1$$$ minute, problem ' B ' in $$$2$$$ minutes, ..., problem ' Z ' in $$$26$$$ minutes. After the contest, you discovered his contest log — a string, consisting of uppercase Latin letters, such that the $$$i$$$-th letter tells which problem Monocarp was solving during the $$$i$$$-th minute of the contest. If Monocarp had spent enough time in total on a problem to solve it, he solved it. Note that Monocarp could have been thinking about a problem after solving it. Given Monocarp's contest log, calculate the number of problems he solved during the contest.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 500$$$) — the duration of the contest, in minutes. The second line contains a string of length exactly $$$n$$$, consisting only of uppercase Latin letters, — Monocarp's contest log.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print a single integer — the number of problems Monocarp solved during the contest.",
