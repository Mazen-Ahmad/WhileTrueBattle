  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of positive integers, and an array $$$x$$$ of length $$$q$$$, also consisting of positive integers. There are $$$q$$$ modification. On the $$$i$$$-th modification ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq q$$$), for each $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq j \\leq n$$$), such that $$$a_j$$$ is divisible by $$$2^{x_i}$$$, you add $$$2^{x_i-1}$$$ to $$$a_j$$$. Note that $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq 30$$$) is a positive integer not exceeding 30 . After all modification queries, you need to output the final array.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, q \\leq 10^5$$$) —the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_n$$$ — the elements of the array $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_q$$$ — the elements of the array $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i \\leq 30$$$), which are the modification queries. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the array after all of the modification queries.",
