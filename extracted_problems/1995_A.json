  "statement": "Vitaly503 is given a checkered board with a side of $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ chips. He realized that all these $$$k$$$ chips need to be placed on the cells of the board (no more than one chip can be placed on a single cell). Let's denote the cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column as $$$(i ,j)$$$. A diagonal is the set of cells for which the value $$$i + j$$$ is the same. For example, cells $$$(3, 1)$$$, $$$(2, 2)$$$, and $$$(1, 3)$$$ lie on the same diagonal, but $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 3)$$$ do not. A diagonal is called occupied if it contains at least one chip. Determine what is the minimum possible number of occupied diagonals among all placements of $$$k$$$ chips.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of sets of input data. Then follow the descriptions of the sets of input data. The only line of each set of input data contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100, 0 \\le k \\le n^2$$$) — the side of the checkered board and the number of available chips, respectively.",
  "outputFormat": "For each set of input data, output a single integer — the minimum number of occupied diagonals with at least one chip that he can get after placing all $$$k$$$ chips.",
