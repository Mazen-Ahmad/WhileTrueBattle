  "statement": "Given an integer array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Let's define the value of the array as its size minus the number of set bits in the bitwise OR of all elements of the array. For example, for the array $$$[1, 0, 1, 2]$$$, the bitwise OR is $$$3$$$ (which contains $$$2$$$ set bits), and the value of the array is $$$4-2=2$$$. Your task is to calculate the maximum possible value of some subsequence of the given array.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < 2^{60}$$$).",
