  "statement": "Tom is waiting for his results of Zhongkao examination. To ease the tense atmosphere, his friend, Daniel, decided to play a game with him. This game is called \" Divide the Array \". The game is about the array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Denote $$$[l,r]$$$ as the subsegment consisting of integers $$$a_l,a_{l+1},\\ldots,a_r$$$. Tom will divide the array into contiguous subsegments $$$[l_1,r_1],[l_2,r_2],\\ldots,[l_m,r_m]$$$, such that each integer is in exactly one subsegment. More formally: For all $$$1\\le i\\le m$$$, $$$1\\le l_i\\le r_i\\le n$$$; $$$l_1=1$$$, $$$r_m=n$$$; For all $$$1< i\\le m$$$, $$$l_i=r_{i-1}+1$$$. Denote $$$s_{i}=\\sum_{k=l_i}^{r_i} a_k$$$, that is, $$$s_i$$$ is the sum of integers in the $$$i$$$-th subsegment. For all $$$1\\le i\\le j\\le m$$$, the following condition must hold: $$$$$$ \\min_{i\\le k\\le j} s_k \\le \\sum_{k=i}^j s_k \\le \\max_{i\\le k\\le j} s_k. $$$$$$ Tom believes that the more subsegments the array $$$a$$$ is divided into, the better results he will get. So he asks Daniel to find the maximum number of subsegments among all possible ways to divide the array $$$a$$$. You have to help him find it.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 50$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 300$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9\\le a_i\\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of subsegments among all possible ways to divide the array $$$a$$$.",
