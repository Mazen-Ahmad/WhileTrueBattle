  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$x$$$ and an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. You have to determine if the number $$$a_1! + a_2! + \\ldots + a_n!$$$ is divisible by $$$x!$$$. Here $$$k!$$$ is a factorial of $$$k$$$ — the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $$$k$$$. For example, $$$3! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$$$, and $$$5! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 120$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 500\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\le x \\le 500\\,000$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le x$$$) — elements of given array.",
  "outputFormat": "In the only line print \" Yes \" (without quotes) if $$$a_1! + a_2! + \\ldots + a_n!$$$ is divisible by $$$x!$$$, and \" No \" (without quotes) otherwise.",
