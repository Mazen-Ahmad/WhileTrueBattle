  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots a_n$$$. Count the number of pairs of indices $$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$ such that $$$a_i < i < a_j < j$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of pairs of indices satisfying the condition in the statement. Please note, that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).",
