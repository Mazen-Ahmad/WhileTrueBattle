  "statement": "You are given a sequence $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, and an integer $$$x$$$. Your task is to make the sequence $$$a$$$ sorted (it is considered sorted if the condition $$$a_1 \\le a_2 \\le a_3 \\le \\dots \\le a_n$$$ holds). To make the sequence sorted, you may perform the following operation any number of times you want (possibly zero): choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ and $$$a_i > x$$$, and swap the values of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$x$$$. For example, if $$$a = [0, 2, 3, 5, 4]$$$, $$$x = 1$$$, the following sequence of operations is possible: choose $$$i = 2$$$ (it is possible since $$$a_2 > x$$$), then $$$a = [0, 1, 3, 5, 4]$$$, $$$x = 2$$$; choose $$$i = 3$$$ (it is possible since $$$a_3 > x$$$), then $$$a = [0, 1, 2, 5, 4]$$$, $$$x = 3$$$; choose $$$i = 4$$$ (it is possible since $$$a_4 > x$$$), then $$$a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]$$$, $$$x = 5$$$. Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform so that $$$a$$$ becomes sorted, or report that it is impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 500$$$, $$$0 \\le x \\le 500$$$) — the number of elements in the sequence and the initial value of $$$x$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 500$$$). The sum of values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $$$500$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you have to perform to make $$$a$$$ sorted, or $$$-1$$$, if it is impossible.",
