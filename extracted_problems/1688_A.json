  "statement": "Even if it's a really easy question, she won't be able to answer it — Perfect Memento in Strict Sense Cirno's perfect bitmasks classroom has just started! Cirno gave her students a positive integer $$$x$$$. As an assignment, her students need to find the minimum positive integer $$$y$$$, which satisfies the following two conditions: $$$$$$x\\ \\texttt{and}\\ y > 0$$$$$$ $$$$$$x\\ \\texttt{xor}\\ y > 0$$$$$$ Where $$$\\texttt{and}$$$ is the bitwise AND operation , and $$$\\texttt{xor}$$$ is the bitwise XOR operation . Among the students was Mystia, who was truly baffled by all these new operators. Please help her!",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of input test cases. For each test case, the only line of input contains one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq 2^{30}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of $$$y$$$.",
