  "statement": "This is an interactive problem! Timofey is writing a competition called Capture the Flag (or CTF for short). He has one task left, which involves hacking a security system. The entire system is based on polynomial hashes$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. Timofey can input a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters into the system, and the system will return its polynomial hash. To hack the system, Timofey needs to find the polynomial hash parameters ($$$p$$$ and $$$m$$$) that the system uses. Timofey doesn't have much time left, so he will only be able to make $$$3$$$ queries. Help him solve the task. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ The polynomial hash of a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters of length $$$n$$$, based on $$$p$$$ and modulo $$$m$$$ is $$$(\\mathrm{ord}(s_1) \\cdot p ^ 0 + \\mathrm{ord}(s_2) \\cdot p ^ 1 + \\mathrm{ord}(s_3) \\cdot p ^ 2 + \\ldots + \\mathrm{ord}(s_n) \\cdot p ^ {n - 1}) \\bmod m$$$. Where $$$s_i$$$ denotes the $$$i$$$-th character of the string $$$s$$$, $$$\\mathrm{ord}(\\mathrm{chr})$$$ denotes the ordinal number of the character $$$\\mathrm{chr}$$$ in the English alphabet, and $$$x \\bmod m$$$ is the remainder of $$$x$$$ when divided by $$$m$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. It is guaranteed that the $$$p$$$ and $$$m$$$ used by the system satisfy the conditions: $$$26 < p \\leq 50$$$ and $$$p + 1 < m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^9$$$.",
