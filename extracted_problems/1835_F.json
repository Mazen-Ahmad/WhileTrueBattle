  "statement": "You are given a bipartite graph $$$G$$$ with the vertex set in the left part $$$L$$$, in the right part $$$R$$$, and $$$m$$$ edges connecting these two sets. We know that $$$|L| = |R| = n$$$. For any subset $$$S \\subseteq L$$$, let $$$N(S)$$$ denote the set of all neighbors of vertices in $$$S$$$. We say that a subset $$$S \\subseteq L$$$ in graph $$$G$$$ is tight if $$$|S| = |N(S)|$$$. We say that graph $$$G$$$ is good if $$$\\forall_{S \\subseteq L}, |S| \\leq |N(S)|$$$. Your task is to verify whether the graph is good and, if so, to optimize it. If the graph is not good, find a subset $$$S \\subseteq L$$$ such that $$$|S| > |N(S)|$$$. However, if the graph is good, your task is to find a good bipartite graph $$$G'$$$ with the same set of vertices $$$L \\cup R$$$, in which $$$\\forall_{S \\subseteq L}$$$, $$$S$$$ is tight in $$$G$$$ if and only if $$$S$$$ is tight in $$$G'$$$. If there are multiple such graphs, choose one with the smallest possible number of edges. If there are still multiple such graphs, print any.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^3$$$, $$$0 \\leq m \\leq n^2$$$), separated by a single space. The number $$$n$$$ denotes the number of vertices in each of the sets $$$L$$$ and $$$R$$$, and the number $$$m$$$ denotes the number of edges between them. The following $$$m$$$ lines describe the edges. Each of them contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq n$$$, $$$n+1 \\leq r \\leq 2 \\cdot n$$$), separated by a single space, indicating that there is an edge from vertex $$$l \\in L$$$ to vertex $$$r \\in R$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "If the graph $$$G$$$ given in the input is not good, output one word \" NO \" in the first line of the output. In the second line of the output, output the number $$$k$$$, and in the third line, output $$$k$$$ numbers $$$l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_k$$$, separated by single spaces. These numbers should indicate that for the set $$$S = \\{l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_k\\}$$$, $$$|S| > |N(S)|$$$. However, if the graph $$$G$$$ given in the input is good, output one word \" YES \" in the first line of the output. In the second line of the output, output the number $$$m'$$$, indicating the number of edges in the new, also good graph $$$G'$$$. Then, in the following $$$m'$$$ lines, output the edges of the graph $$$G'$$$ in the same format as given in the input.",
