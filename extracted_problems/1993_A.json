  "statement": "Tim is doing a test consisting of $$$4n$$$ questions; each question has $$$4$$$ options: ' A ', ' B ', ' C ', and ' D '. For each option, there are exactly $$$n$$$ correct answers corresponding to that option — meaning there are $$$n$$$ questions with the answer ' A ', $$$n$$$ questions with the answer ' B ', $$$n$$$ questions with the answer ' C ', and $$$n$$$ questions with the answer ' D '. For each question, Tim wrote his answer on the answer sheet. If he could not figure out the answer, he would leave a question mark ' ? ' for that question. You are given his answer sheet of $$$4n$$$ characters. What is the maximum number of correct answers Tim can get?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$). The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of $$$4n$$$ characters ($$$s_i \\in \\{\\texttt{A}, \\texttt{B}, \\texttt{C}, \\texttt{D}, \\texttt{?}\\}$$$) — Tim's answers for the questions.",
