  "statement": "You are given an $$$n \\times n$$$ grid. We write $$$(i, j)$$$ to denote the cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column. For each cell, you are told whether yon can delete it or not. Given an integer $$$k$$$, you are asked to delete exactly $$$(n-k+1)^2$$$ cells from the grid such that the following condition holds. You cannot find $$$k$$$ not deleted cells $$$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_k, y_k)$$$ that are strictly increasing, i.e., $$$x_i < x_{i+1}$$$ and $$$y_i < y_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i < k$$$. Your task is to find a solution, or report that it is impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$). Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains a binary string $$$s_i$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The $$$j$$$-th character of $$$s_i$$$ is 1 if you can delete cell $$$(i, j)$$$, and 0 otherwise. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no way to delete exactly $$$(n-k+1)^2$$$ cells to meet the condition, output \" NO \" (without quotes). Otherwise, output \" YES \" (without quotes). Then, output $$$n$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain a binary string $$$t_i$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The $$$j$$$-th character of $$$t_i$$$ is 0 if cell $$$(i, j)$$$ is deleted, and 1 otherwise. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them. You can output \" YES \" and \" NO \" in any case (for example, strings \" yEs \", \" yes \" and \" Yes \" will be recognized as a positive response).",
