  "statement": "This is the easy version of this problem. The difference between easy and hard versions is only the constraints on $$$a_i$$$ and on $$$n$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. Burenka is the crown princess of Buryatia, and soon she will become the $$$n$$$-th queen of the country. There is an ancient tradition in Buryatia — before the coronation, the ruler must show their strength to the inhabitants. To determine the strength of the $$$n$$$-th ruler, the inhabitants of the country give them an array of $$$a$$$ of exactly $$$n$$$ numbers, after which the ruler must turn all the elements of the array into zeros in the shortest time. The ruler can do the following two-step operation any number of times: select two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, so that $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$ and a non-negative integer $$$x$$$, then for all $$$l \\leq i \\leq r$$$ assign $$$a_i := a_i \\oplus x$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation . It takes $$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{r-l+1}{2} \\right\\rceil$$$ seconds to do this operation, where $$$\\lceil y \\rceil$$$ denotes $$$y$$$ rounded up to the nearest integer. Help Burenka calculate how much time she will need.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5000$$$) — the size of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 5000$$$) — elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ in all tests does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single number — the minimum time that Burenka will need.",
