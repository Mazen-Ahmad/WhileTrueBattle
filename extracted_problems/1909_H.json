  "statement": "Dubmood - Keygen 8 ⠀ You are given a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$ of $$$[1, 2, \\dots, n]$$$. You can perform the following operation some (possibly $$$0$$$) times: choose a subarray $$$[l, r]$$$ of even length; swap $$$a_l$$$, $$$a_{l+1}$$$; swap $$$a_{l+2}$$$, $$$a_{l+3}$$$ (if $$$l+3 \\leq r$$$); $$$\\dots$$$ swap $$$a_{r-1}$$$, $$$a_r$$$. Sort the permutation in at most $$$10^6$$$ operations. You do not need to minimize the number of operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$, the $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) — the permutation before performing the operations.",
  "outputFormat": "Output your operations in the following format. The first line should contain an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le 10^6$$$) — the number of operations. The next $$$k$$$ lines represent the $$$k$$$ operations in order. Each of these $$$k$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l < r \\leq n$$$, $$$r-l+1$$$ must be even) — the corresponding operation consists in choosing the subarray $$$[l, r]$$$ and swapping its elements according to the problem statement. After all the operations, $$$a_i = i$$$ must be true for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$).",
