  "statement": "When organizing a big event, organizers often handle side tasks outside their expertise. For example, the chief judge of EUC 2025 must find a name for the event's official mascot while satisfying certain constraints: The name must include specific words as subsequences$$$^{\\texttt{*}}$$$, such as the event name and location. You are given the list $$$s_1,\\, s_2,\\, \\ldots,\\, s_n$$$ of the $$$n$$$ required words. The name must not contain as a subsequence$$$^{\\texttt{*}}$$$ the name $$$t$$$ of last year's mascot. Please help the chief judge find a valid mascot name or determine that none exists. $$$^{\\texttt{*}}$$$ A string $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by erasing some characters (at any positions) while keeping the remaining characters in the same order. For example, $$$\\texttt{abc}$$$ is a subsequence of $$$\\texttt{axbycz}$$$ but not of $$$\\texttt{acbxyz}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 200\\,000$$$) — the number of words that shall appear as subsequences. The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains the string $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1\\le |s_i| \\le 200\\,000$$$, $$$s_i$$$ consists of lowercase English letters) — the $$$i$$$-th word in the list of words that shall appear as subsequences. The total length of these $$$n$$$ words is at most $$$200\\,000$$$, i.e., $$$|s_1| + |s_2| + \\cdots + |s_n| \\le 200\\,000$$$. The last line contains the string $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le |t| \\le 200\\,000$$$, $$$t$$$ consists of lowercase English letters) — the name of last year's mascot.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if there is a valid name for the mascot. Otherwise, print $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$. If there is a valid name, on the next line print a valid name. The string you print must have length at most $$$1\\,000\\,000$$$ and must consist of lowercase English letters. One can prove that if a valid name for the mascot exists, then there is one satisfying these additional constraints. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
