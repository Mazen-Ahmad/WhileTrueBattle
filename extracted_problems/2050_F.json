  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$. For each query, find the maximum possible $$$m$$$, such that all elements $$$a_l$$$, $$$a_{l+1}$$$, ..., $$$a_r$$$ are equal modulo $$$m$$$. In other words, $$$a_l \\bmod m = a_{l+1} \\bmod m = \\dots = a_r \\bmod m$$$, where $$$a \\bmod b$$$ — is the remainder of division $$$a$$$ by $$$b$$$. In particular, when $$$m$$$ can be infinite, print $$$0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array and the number of queries. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. In the following $$$q$$$ lines of each test case, two integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ are provided ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) — the range of the query. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$q$$$ does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, output the maximum value $$$m$$$ described in the statement.",
