  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of characters A and B . Your task is to split it into blocks of length $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ in such a way that there are no more than $$$a$$$ strings equal to \" A \"; there are no more than $$$b$$$ strings equal to \" B \"; there are no more than $$$ab$$$ strings \" AB \"; there are no more than $$$ba$$$ strings \" BA \"; Strings \" AA \" and \" BB \" are prohibited. Each character of the initial string $$$s$$$ should belong to exactly one block.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Next, $$$t$$$ independent cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) consisting only of characters A and/or B . The second line of each test case contains four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$ab$$$, and $$$ba$$$ ($$$0 \\le a, b, ab, ba \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the maximum allowed number of strings \" A \", \" B \", \" AB \", and \" BA \" correspondingly. It's guaranteed that the total length of $$$s$$$ doesn't exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$ over all test cases.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print YES if it's possible to split string $$$s$$$. Otherwise, print NO .",
