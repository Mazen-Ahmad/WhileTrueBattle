  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. In this version $$$l=r$$$. You are given a string $$$s$$$. For a fixed $$$k$$$, consider a division of $$$s$$$ into exactly $$$k$$$ continuous substrings $$$w_1,\\dots,w_k$$$. Let $$$f_k$$$ be the maximal possible $$$LCP(w_1,\\dots,w_k)$$$ among all divisions. $$$LCP(w_1,\\dots,w_m)$$$ is the length of the Longest Common Prefix of the strings $$$w_1,\\dots,w_m$$$. For example, if $$$s=abababcab$$$ and $$$k=4$$$, a possible division is $$$\\color{red}{ab}\\color{blue}{ab}\\color{orange}{abc}\\color{green}{ab}$$$. The $$$LCP(\\color{red}{ab},\\color{blue}{ab},\\color{orange}{abc},\\color{green}{ab})$$$ is $$$2$$$, since $$$ab$$$ is the Longest Common Prefix of those four strings. Note that each substring consists of a continuous segment of characters and each character belongs to exactly one substring. Your task is to find $$$f_l,f_{l+1},\\dots,f_r$$$. In this version $$$l=r$$$ .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l = r \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string and the given range. The second line of each test case contains string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, all characters are lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$r-l+1$$$ values: $$$f_l,\\dots,f_r$$$.",
