  "statement": "Given integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, construct a sequence of $$$n$$$ non-negative (i.e. $$$\\geq 0$$$) integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ such that $$$\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k$$$ The number of $$$1$$$s in the binary representation of $$$a_1 | a_2 | \\ldots | a_n$$$ is maximized, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of non-negative integers to be printed and the sum respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ on a new line that satisfies the conditions given above. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
