  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. A positive integer $$$x$$$ is called good if it is impossible to find a subsegment$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ of the array such that the least common multiple of all its elements is equal to $$$x$$$. You need to find the smallest good integer. A subsegment$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ of the array $$$a$$$ is a set of elements $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ for some $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$. We will denote such subsegment as $$$[l, r]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the smallest good integer.",
