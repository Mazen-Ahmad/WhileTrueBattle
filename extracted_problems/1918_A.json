  "statement": "A brick is a strip of size $$$1 \\times k$$$, placed horizontally or vertically, where $$$k$$$ can be an arbitrary number that is at least $$$2$$$ ($$$k \\ge 2$$$). A brick wall of size $$$n \\times m$$$ is such a way to place several bricks inside a rectangle $$$n \\times m$$$, that all bricks lie either horizontally or vertically in the cells, do not cross the border of the rectangle, and that each cell of the $$$n \\times m$$$ rectangle belongs to exactly one brick. Here $$$n$$$ is the height of the rectangle $$$n \\times m$$$ and $$$m$$$ is the width. Note that there can be bricks with different values of k in the same brick wall. The wall stability is the difference between the number of horizontal bricks and the number of vertical bricks. Note that if you used $$$0$$$ horizontal bricks and $$$2$$$ vertical ones, then the stability will be $$$-2$$$, not $$$2$$$ . What is the maximal possible stability of a wall of size $$$n \\times m$$$? It is guaranteed that under restrictions in the statement at least one $$$n \\times m$$$ wall exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$), the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n,\\,m \\le 10^4$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer, the maximum stability of a wall of size $$$n \\times m$$$.",
