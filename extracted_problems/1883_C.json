  "statement": "You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and a number $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq k \\leq 5$$$). In one operation, you can do the following: Choose an index $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, Set $$$a_i = a_i + 1$$$. Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the product of all the numbers in the array $$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot a_n$$$ divisible by $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\leq k \\leq 5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$ and the number $$$k$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum number of operations needed to make the product of all the numbers in the array divisible by $$$k$$$.",
