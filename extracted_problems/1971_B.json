  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Rearrange the characters of $$$s$$$ to form a new string $$$r$$$ that is not equal to $$$s$$$, or report that it's impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length at most $$$10$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if no such string $$$r$$$ exists as described in the statement, output \" NO \" (without quotes). Otherwise, output \" YES \" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string $$$r$$$, consisting of letters of string $$$s$$$. You can output \" YES \" and \" NO \" in any case (for example, strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", and \" Yes \" will be recognized as a positive response). If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.",
