  "statement": "Iva and Pav are a famous Serbian competitive programming couple. In Serbia, they call Pav \"papuca\" and that's why he will make all of Iva's wishes come true. Iva gave Pav an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements. Let's define $$$f(l, r) = a_l \\ \\& \\ a_{l+1} \\ \\& \\dots \\& \\ a_r$$$ (here $$$\\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation ). Note that $$$f(l, r)$$$ is not defined when $$$l>r$$$. Iva also gave Pav $$$q$$$ queries. Each query consists of 2 numbers, $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$, and she wants Pav to find the largest index $$$r$$$ ($$$l \\le r \\le n$$$), such that $$$f(l, r) \\ge k$$$. Pav wants to solve this problem fast because he doesn't want to upset Iva. He needs your help.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of queries Iva gave Pav. The next $$$q$$$ lines of each test case contains two numbers, $$$l$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$) — the left bound for the subsegment, and the integer $$$k$$$ described in statement. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. Also, it is guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query output maximal index $$$r$$$ ($$$l \\le r \\le n$$$) such that $$$a_l \\ \\& \\ a_{l+1} \\ \\& \\dots \\& \\ a_r \\ \\ge \\ k$$$. If such $$$r$$$ doesn't exist, output $$$-1$$$.",
