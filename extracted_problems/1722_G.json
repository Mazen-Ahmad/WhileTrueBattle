  "statement": "Given an integer $$$n$$$, find any array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ distinct nonnegative integers less than $$$2^{31}$$$ such that the bitwise XOR of the elements on odd indices equals the bitwise XOR of the elements on even indices.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 629$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ lines follow, each containing a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(3 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5)$$$ — the length of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one line containing $$$n$$$ distinct integers that satisfy the conditions. If there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.",
