  "statement": "You are playing a famous computer game (that just works) where you have various skills you can level up. Today, you focused on the \"Smithing\" skill. Your tactic is obvious: forging weapons from ingots and then melting them back to return the materials partially. For simplicity, every time you create an item, you get $$$1$$$ experience point, and every time you melt an item, you also get $$$1$$$ experience point. There are $$$n$$$ classes of weapons you can forge and $$$m$$$ types of metal ingots. You can create one weapon of the $$$i$$$-th class, spending $$$a_i$$$ ingots of metal of the same type . Melting a weapon of the $$$i$$$-th class (which you crafted earlier) returns you $$$b_i$$$ ingots of the type of metal it was made of . You have $$$c_j$$$ metal ingots of the $$$j$$$-th type, and you know that you can craft a weapon of any class from any metal type. Each combination of a weapon class and a metal type can be used any number of times. What is the maximum total amount of experience you can earn by crafting and melting weapons?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 10^6$$$) — the number of weapon classes and metal types. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of ingots you need to forge one weapon of the $$$i$$$-th class. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le b_i < a_i$$$), where $$$b_i$$$ is the number of ingots you return by melting one weapon of the $$$i$$$-th class you forged earlier. The fourth line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_j \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of ingots you have of the corresponding metal type.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer — the maximum total experience points you can gain by repeatedly forging and melting weapons.",
