  "statement": "A set of positive integers $$$S$$$ is called beautiful if, for every two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ from this set, either $$$x$$$ divides $$$y$$$ or $$$y$$$ divides $$$x$$$ (or both). You are given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. Consider all beautiful sets consisting of integers not less than $$$l$$$ and not greater than $$$r$$$. You have to print two numbers: the maximum possible size of a beautiful set where all elements are from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$; the number of beautiful sets consisting of integers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ with the maximum possible size. Since the second number can be very large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^6$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print two integers — the maximum possible size of a beautiful set consisting of integers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$, and the number of such sets with maximum possible size. Since the second number can be very large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
