  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, and $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is represented by two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$). Your task is to find, for each query, two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ (or determine that they do not exist) such that: $$$l \\le i \\le r$$$; $$$l \\le j \\le r$$$; $$$a_i \\ne a_j$$$. In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements among $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r$$$, or report that such a pair does not exist.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. The next $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers each, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l < r \\le n$$$) — the boundaries of the query. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$q$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, output two integers separated by space: $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$l \\le i, j \\le r$$$), for which $$$a_i \\ne a_j$$$. If such a pair does not exist, output $$$i=-1$$$ and $$$j=-1$$$. You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not a mandatory requirement.",
