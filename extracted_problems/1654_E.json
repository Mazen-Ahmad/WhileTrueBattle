  "statement": "You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. You can do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose any index $$$i$$$ and set $$$a_i$$$ to any integer (positive, negative or $$$0$$$). What is the minimum number of operations needed to turn $$$a$$$ into an arithmetic progression? The array $$$a$$$ is an arithmetic progression if $$$a_{i+1}-a_i=a_i-a_{i-1}$$$ for any $$$2 \\leq i \\leq n-1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5$$$).",
