  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You can perform the following operation on it: Choose a pair of elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$ and $$$i \\neq j$$$); Choose one of the divisors of the integer $$$a_i$$$, i.e., an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$a_i \\bmod x = 0$$$; Replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\\frac{a_i}{x}$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ with $$$a_j \\cdot x$$$. Determine whether it is possible to make all elements in the array the same by applying the operation a certain number of times (possibly zero). For example, let's consider the array $$$a$$$ = [$$$100, 2, 50, 10, 1$$$] with $$$5$$$ elements. Perform two operations on it: Choose $$$a_3 = 50$$$ and $$$a_2 = 2$$$, $$$x = 5$$$. Replace $$$a_3$$$ with $$$\\frac{a_3}{x} = \\frac{50}{5} = 10$$$, and $$$a_2$$$ with $$$a_2 \\cdot x = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10$$$. The resulting array is $$$a$$$ = [$$$100, 10, 10, 10, 1$$$]; Choose $$$a_1 = 100$$$ and $$$a_5 = 1$$$, $$$x = 10$$$. Replace $$$a_1$$$ with $$$\\frac{a_1}{x} = \\frac{100}{10} = 10$$$, and $$$a_5$$$ with $$$a_5 \\cdot x = 1 \\cdot 10 = 10$$$. The resulting array is $$$a$$$ = [$$$10, 10, 10, 10, 10$$$]. After performing these operations, all elements in the array $$$a$$$ become equal to $$$10$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of each test case. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line: \" YES \" if it is possible to make all elements in the array equal by applying the operation a certain (possibly zero) number of times; \" NO \" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \", and \" YES \" will all be recognized as a positive answer).",
