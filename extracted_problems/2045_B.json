  "statement": "ICPC Square is a hotel provided by the ICPC Committee for the accommodation of the participants. It consists of $$$N$$$ floors (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$). This hotel has a very unique elevator. If a person is currently at floor $$$x$$$, by riding the elevator once, they can go to floor $$$y$$$ if and only if $$$y$$$ is a multiple of $$$x$$$ and $$$y - x \\leq D$$$. You are currently at floor $$$S$$$. You want to go to the highest possible floor by riding the elevator zero or more times. Determine the highest floor you can reach.",
