  "statement": "Imi has an undirected tree with $$$n$$$ vertices where edges are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. The $$$i$$$-th edge connects vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. There are also $$$k$$$ butterflies on the tree. Initially, the $$$i$$$-th butterfly is on vertex $$$a_i$$$. All values of $$$a$$$ are pairwise distinct. Koxia plays a game as follows: For $$$i = 1, 2, \\dots, n - 1$$$, Koxia set the direction of the $$$i$$$-th edge as $$$u_i \\rightarrow v_i$$$ or $$$v_i \\rightarrow u_i$$$ with equal probability. For $$$i = 1, 2, \\dots, n - 1$$$, if a butterfly is on the initial vertex of $$$i$$$-th edge and there is no butterfly on the terminal vertex, then this butterfly flies to the terminal vertex. Note that operations are sequentially in order of $$$1, 2, \\dots, n - 1$$$ instead of simultaneously. Koxia chooses two butterflies from the $$$k$$$ butterflies with equal probability from all possible $$$\\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$$$ ways to select two butterflies, then she takes the distance$$$^\\dagger$$$ between the two chosen vertices as her score. Now, Koxia wants you to find the expected value of her score, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353^\\ddagger$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$ The distance between two vertices on a tree is the number of edges on the (unique) simple path between them. $$$^\\ddagger$$$ Formally, let $$$M = 998\\,244\\,353$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot {10}^5$$$) — the size of the tree and the number of butterflies. The second line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the initial position of butterflies. It's guaranteed that all positions are distinct. The $$$i$$$-th line in following $$$n − 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n$$$, $$$u_i \\neq v_i$$$) — the vertices the $$$i$$$-th edge connects. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.",
  "outputFormat": "Output a single integer — the expected value of Koxia's score, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
