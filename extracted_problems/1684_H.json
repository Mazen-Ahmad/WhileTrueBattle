  "statement": "You are given a binary string $$$s$$$. You have to cut it into any number of non-intersecting substrings, so that the sum of binary integers denoted by these substrings is a power of 2. Each element of $$$s$$$ should be in exactly one substring.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows. Each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output the answer to the problem as follows: If the answer does not exist, output $$$-1$$$. If the answer exists, firstly output an integer $$$k$$$ — the number of substrings in the answer. After that output $$$k$$$ non-intersecting substrings, for $$$i$$$-th substring output two integers $$$l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i, r_i \\le |s|$$$) — the description of $$$i$$$-th substring. If there are multiple valid solutions, you can output any of them.",
