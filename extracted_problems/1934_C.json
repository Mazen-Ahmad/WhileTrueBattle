  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. You are given a grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. The coordinates $$$(x, y)$$$ represent the cell on the grid, where $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq n$$$) is the row number counting from the top and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\leq y \\leq m$$$) is the column number counting from the left. It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ mines in the grid at distinct cells, denoted as $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$. You are allowed to make no more than $$$4$$$ queries to the interactor, and after these queries, you need to provide the location of one of the mines . In each query, you can choose any grid cell $$$(x, y)$$$, and in return, you will receive the minimum Manhattan distance from both the mines to the chosen cell, i.e., you will receive the value $$$\\min(|x-x_1|+|y-y_1|, |x-x_2|+|y-y_2|)$$$. Your task is to determine the location of one of the mines after making the queries.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^{3}$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^{8}$$$, $$$2 \\leq m \\leq 10^{8}$$$) — the number of rows and columns.",
