  "statement": "You are given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, where $$$l < r$$$. We will add $$$1$$$ to $$$l$$$ until the result is equal to $$$r$$$. Thus, there will be exactly $$$r-l$$$ additions performed. For each such addition, let's look at the number of digits that will be changed after it. For example: if $$$l=909$$$, then adding one will result in $$$910$$$ and $$$2$$$ digits will be changed; if you add one to $$$l=9$$$, the result will be $$$10$$$ and $$$2$$$ digits will also be changed; if you add one to $$$l=489999$$$, the result will be $$$490000$$$ and $$$5$$$ digits will be changed. Changed digits always form a suffix of the result written in the decimal system. Output the total number of changed digits, if you want to get $$$r$$$ from $$$l$$$, adding $$$1$$$ each time.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case is characterized by two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l < r \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, calculate the total number of changed digits if you want to get $$$r$$$ from $$$l$$$, adding one each time.",
