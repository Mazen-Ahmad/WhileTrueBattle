  "statement": "Recently, your friend discovered one special operation on an integer array $$$a$$$: Choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \\neq j$$$); Set $$$a_i = a_j = |a_i - a_j|$$$. After playing with this operation for a while, he came to the next conclusion: For every array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, where $$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$, you can find a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that the total sum of $$$a$$$ will decrease after performing the operation. This statement sounds fishy to you, so you want to find a counterexample for a given integer $$$n$$$. Can you find such counterexample and prove him wrong? In other words, find an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) such that for all pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ performing the operation won't decrease the total sum (it will increase or not change the sum).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 1000$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no counterexample array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$, print NO . Otherwise, print YES followed by the array $$$a$$$ itself ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). If there are multiple counterexamples, print any.",
