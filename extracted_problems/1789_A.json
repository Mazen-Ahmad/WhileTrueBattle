  "statement": "Mocha likes arrays, and Serval gave her an array consisting of positive integers as a gift. Mocha thinks that for an array of positive integers $$$a$$$, it is good iff the greatest common divisor of all the elements in $$$a$$$ is no more than its length. And for an array of at least $$$2$$$ positive integers, it is beautiful iff all of its prefixes whose length is no less than $$$2$$$ are good. For example: $$$[3,6]$$$ is not good, because $$$\\gcd(3,6)=3$$$ is greater than its length $$$2$$$. $$$[1,2,4]$$$ is both good and beautiful, because all of its prefixes whose length is no less than $$$2$$$, which are $$$[1,2]$$$ and $$$[1,2,4]$$$, are both good. $$$[3,6,1]$$$ is good but not beautiful, because $$$[3,6]$$$ is not good. Now Mocha gives you the gift array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers, and she wants to know whether array $$$a$$$ could become beautiful by reordering the elements in $$$a$$$. It is allowed to keep the array $$$a$$$ unchanged.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 100$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n\\leq 10^6$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print Yes if it is possible to reorder the elements in $$$a$$$ to make it beautiful, and print No if not. You can output Yes and No in any case (for example, strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).",
