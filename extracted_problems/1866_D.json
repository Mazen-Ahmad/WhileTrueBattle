  "statement": "There are $$$N$$$ arrays, each array has $$$M$$$ positive integer elements The $$$j$$$-th element of the $$$i$$$-th array is $$$A_{i,j}$$$. Initially, Chaneka's digital wallet contains $$$0$$$ money. Given an integer $$$K$$$. Chaneka will do $$$M-K+1$$$ operations. In the $$$p$$$-th operation, Chaneka does the following procedure: Choose any array. Let's say Chaneka chooses the $$$x$$$-th array. Choose an index $$$y$$$ in that array such that $$$p \\leq y \\leq p+K-1$$$. Add the value of $$$A_{x, y}$$$ to the total money in the wallet. Change the value of $$$A_{x, y}$$$ into $$$0$$$. Determine the maximum total money that can be earned!",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $$$N$$$, $$$M$$$, and $$$K$$$ ($$$1 \\leq N \\leq 10$$$; $$$1 \\leq M \\leq 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\leq K \\leq \\min(10, M)$$$) — the number of arrays, the size of each array, and the constant that describes the operation constraints. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$N$$$ lines contains $$$M$$$ integers $$$A_{i,1}, A_{i,2}, \\ldots, A_{i,M}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A_{i,j} \\leq 10^6$$$) — the elements of the $$$i$$$-th array.",
