  "statement": "The cost of a positive integer $$$n$$$ is defined as the result of dividing the number $$$n$$$ by the sum of its digits. For example, the cost of the number $$$104$$$ is $$$\\frac{104}{1 + 0 + 4} = 20.8$$$, and the cost of the number $$$111$$$ is $$$\\frac{111}{1 + 1 + 1} = 37$$$. You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$ that does not contain leading zeros. You can remove any number of digits from the number $$$n$$$ (including none) so that the remaining number contains at least one digit and is strictly greater than zero . The remaining digits cannot be rearranged. As a result, you may end up with a number that has leading zeros. For example, you are given the number $$$103554$$$. If you decide to remove the digits $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$, and one digit $$$5$$$, you will end up with the number $$$035$$$, whose cost is $$$\\frac{035}{0 + 3 + 5} = 4.375$$$. What is the minimum number of digits you need to remove from the number so that its cost becomes the minimum possible?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n < 10^{100}$$$) without leading zeros.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer on a new line — the number of digits that need to be removed from the number so that its cost becomes minimal.",
