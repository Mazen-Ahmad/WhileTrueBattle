  "statement": "On the official website of Berland, each account has two parameters: username and ID. Username is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or digits, which contains at least one letter. For example, user0 , 1fox1 , zzzz are correct usernames, but 1337 and User22 are not. The ID of the account for a given username is generated as follows: a positive integer without leading zeroes is appended to the end of the username. For example, the ID user0125 can be generated by the following usernames: user012 , user01 , user0 ; but neither by user nor us . You are given a string $$$s$$$ — a valid ID. Your task is to determine any valid username that can generate the given ID. If there are several correct usernames, you can print any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$2 \\le |s| \\le 50$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or digits. Additional constraint on input: there is at least one valid username that can generate the given ID.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case on a separate line, print a string — any valid username that can generate the given ID. If there are multiple correct usernames, you can print any of them.",
