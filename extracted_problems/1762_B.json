  "statement": "An array $$$b$$$ of $$$m$$$ positive integers is good if for all pairs $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i,j \\leq m$$$), $$$\\max(b_i,b_j)$$$ is divisible by $$$\\min(b_i,b_j)$$$. You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You can perform the following operation: Select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) and an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\leq x \\leq a_i$$$) and add $$$x$$$ to $$$a_i$$$, in other words, $$$a_i := a_i+x$$$. After this operation, $$$a_i \\leq 10^{18}$$$ should be satisfied. You have to construct a sequence of at most $$$n$$$ operations that will make $$$a$$$ good. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, such a sequence of operations always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — representing the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test, output a single integer $$$p$$$ ($$$0 \\leq p \\leq n$$$) — denoting the number of operations in your solution. In each of the following $$$p$$$ lines, output two space-separated integers — $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$. You do not need to minimize the number of operations. It can be proven that a solution always exists.",
