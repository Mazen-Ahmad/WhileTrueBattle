  "statement": "Consider an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ consisting of numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$-1$$$. Define $$$A$$$-characteristic of this array as a number of pairs of indices $$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$, such that $$$a_i \\cdot a_j = 1$$$. Find any array $$$a$$$ with given length $$$n$$$ with $$$A$$$-characteristic equal to the given value $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le \\frac{(n-1) n}{2}$$$) â€” the length of required array and required $$$A$$$-characteristic.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no array $$$a$$$ with given $$$A$$$-characteristic $$$k$$$, print NO . Otherwise, print YES and $$$n$$$ numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$-1$$$, which form the required array $$$a$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
