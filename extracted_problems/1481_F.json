  "statement": "Kilani and Abd are neighbors for 3000 years, but then the day came and Kilani decided to move to another house. As a farewell gift, Kilani is going to challenge Abd with a problem written by their other neighbor with the same name Abd. The problem is: You are given a connected tree rooted at node $$$1$$$. You should assign a character a or b to every node in the tree so that the total number of a 's is equal to $$$x$$$ and the total number of b 's is equal to $$$n - x$$$. Let's define a string for each node $$$v$$$ of the tree as follows: if $$$v$$$ is root then the string is just one character assigned to $$$v$$$: otherwise, let's take a string defined for the $$$v$$$'s parent $$$p_v$$$ and add to the end of it a character assigned to $$$v$$$. You should assign every node a character in a way that minimizes the number of distinct strings among the strings of all nodes.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$; $$$0 \\leq x \\leq n$$$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree the number of a 's. The second line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$; $$$p_i \\neq i$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the parent of node $$$i$$$. It is guaranteed that the input describes a connected tree.",
  "outputFormat": "In the first line, print the minimum possible total number of distinct strings. In the second line, print $$$n$$$ characters, where all characters are either a or b and the $$$i$$$-th character is the character assigned to the $$$i$$$-th node. Make sure that the total number of a 's is equal to $$$x$$$ and the total number of b 's is equal to $$$n - x$$$. If there is more than one answer you can print any of them.",
