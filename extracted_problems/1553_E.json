  "statement": "An identity permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array $$$[1, 2, 3, \\dots, n]$$$. We performed the following operations to an identity permutation of length $$$n$$$: firstly, we cyclically shifted it to the right by $$$k$$$ positions, where $$$k$$$ is unknown to you (the only thing you know is that $$$0 \\le k \\le n - 1$$$). When an array is cyclically shifted to the right by $$$k$$$ positions, the resulting array is formed by taking $$$k$$$ last elements of the original array (without changing their relative order), and then appending $$$n - k$$$ first elements to the right of them (without changing relative order of the first $$$n - k$$$ elements as well). For example, if we cyclically shift the identity permutation of length $$$6$$$ by $$$2$$$ positions, we get the array $$$[5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]$$$; secondly, we performed the following operation at most $$$m$$$ times: pick any two elements of the array and swap them. You are given the values of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, and the resulting array. Your task is to find all possible values of $$$k$$$ in the cyclic shift operation.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$0 \\le m \\le \\frac{n}{3}$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$, each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears in this sequence exactly once) — the resulting array. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer in the following way: firstly, print one integer $$$r$$$ ($$$0 \\le r \\le n$$$) — the number of possible values of $$$k$$$ for the cyclic shift operation; secondly, print $$$r$$$ integers $$$k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_r$$$ ($$$0 \\le k_i \\le n - 1$$$) — all possible values of $$$k$$$ in increasing order .",
