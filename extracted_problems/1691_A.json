  "statement": "Given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, find the minimum number of elements to remove from the sequence such that after the removal, the sum of every $$$2$$$ consecutive elements is even.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq10^9$$$) — elements of the sequence. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
