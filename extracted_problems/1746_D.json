  "statement": "You are given a rooted tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and the root is the vertex $$$1$$$. You are also given a score array $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$. A multiset of $$$k$$$ simple paths is called valid if the following two conditions are both true. Each path starts from $$$1$$$. Let $$$c_i$$$ be the number of paths covering vertex $$$i$$$. For each pair of vertices $$$(u,v)$$$ ($$$2\\le u,v\\le n$$$) that have the same parent, $$$|c_u-c_v|\\le 1$$$ holds. The value of the path multiset is defined as $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n c_i s_i$$$. It can be shown that it is always possible to find at least one valid multiset. Find the maximum value among all valid multisets.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$) — the size of the tree and the required number of paths. The second line contains $$$n - 1$$$ space-separated integers $$$p_2,p_3,\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\\le p_i\\le n$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the parent of the $$$i$$$-th vertex. It is guaranteed that this value describe a valid tree with root $$$1$$$. The third line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$s_1,s_2,\\ldots,s_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le s_i \\le 10^4$$$) — the scores of the vertices. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.",
