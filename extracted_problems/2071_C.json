  "statement": "In an Italian village, a hungry mouse starts at vertex $$$\\textrm{st}$$$ on a given tree$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices. Given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$, there are $$$n$$$ steps. For the $$$i$$$-th step: A tempting piece of Parmesan cheese appears at vertex $$$p_i$$$. If the mouse is currently at vertex $$$p_i$$$, it will stay there and enjoy the moment. Otherwise, it will move along the simple path to vertex $$$p_i$$$ by one edge . Your task is to find such a permutation so that, after all $$$n$$$ steps, the mouse inevitably arrives at vertex $$$\\textrm{en}$$$, where a trap awaits. Note that the mouse must arrive at $$$\\textrm{en}$$$ after all $$$n$$$ steps, though it may pass through $$$\\textrm{en}$$$ earlier during the process. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A tree is a connected graph without cycles. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$\\textrm{st}$$$, and $$$\\textrm{en}$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le \\textrm{st}, \\textrm{en} \\le n$$$) — the number of vertices of the tree, the starting vertex, and the trap vertex. Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$) — the indices of the vertices connected by an edge. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case: If no such permutation exists, output $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$, representing the order in which the cheese will appear at the vertices, ensuring the mouse will eventually be caught at vertex $$$\\textrm{en}$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
