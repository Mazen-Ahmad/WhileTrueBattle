  "statement": "Steve has a permutation$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ and an array $$$c$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. Steve wishes to sort the permutation $$$p$$$. Steve has an infinite supply of coloured sand blocks, and using them he discovered a physics-based way to sort an array of numbers called gravity sort. Namely, to perform gravity sort on $$$p$$$, Steve will do the following: For all $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, place a sand block of color $$$c_i$$$ in position $$$(i, j)$$$ for all $$$j$$$ where $$$1 \\le j \\le p_i$$$. Here, position $$$(x, y)$$$ denotes a cell in the $$$x$$$-th row from the top and $$$y$$$-th column from the left. Apply downwards gravity to the array, so that all sand blocks fall as long as they can fall. An example of gravity sort for the third testcase. $$$p = [4, 2, 3, 1, 5]$$$, $$$c = [2, 1, 4, 1, 5]$$$ Alex looks at Steve's sand blocks after performing gravity sort and wonders how many pairs of arrays $$$(p',c')$$$ where $$$p'$$$ is a permutation would have resulted in the same layout of sand. Note that the original pair of arrays $$$(p, c)$$$ will always be counted. Please calculate this for Alex. As this number could be large, output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is a $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each testcase contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the lengths of the arrays. The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of $$$p$$$. The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of $$$c$$$. The sum of $$$n$$$ across all testcases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, output the number of pairs of arrays $$$(p', c')$$$ Steve could have started with, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
