  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ heaps of stone. The $$$i$$$-th heap has $$$h_i$$$ stones. You want to change the number of stones in the heap by performing the following process once: You go through the heaps from the $$$3$$$-rd heap to the $$$n$$$-th heap, in this order. Let $$$i$$$ be the number of the current heap. You can choose a number $$$d$$$ ($$$0 \\le 3 \\cdot d \\le h_i$$$), move $$$d$$$ stones from the $$$i$$$-th heap to the $$$(i - 1)$$$-th heap, and $$$2 \\cdot d$$$ stones from the $$$i$$$-th heap to the $$$(i - 2)$$$-th heap. So after that $$$h_i$$$ is decreased by $$$3 \\cdot d$$$, $$$h_{i - 1}$$$ is increased by $$$d$$$, and $$$h_{i - 2}$$$ is increased by $$$2 \\cdot d$$$. You can choose different or same $$$d$$$ for different operations. Some heaps may become empty, but they still count as heaps. What is the maximum number of stones in the smallest heap after the process?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second lines of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, h_3, \\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le h_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the maximum number of stones that the smallest heap can contain.",
