  "statement": "Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$8$$$, $$$9$$$, .... For a given number $$$n$$$, count the number of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such $$$x$$$ that $$$x$$$ is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 20$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ lines contain the test cases, one per line. Each of the lines contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer you are looking for — the number of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ that Polycarp likes.",
