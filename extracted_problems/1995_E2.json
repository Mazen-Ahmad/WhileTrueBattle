  "statement": "This is the hard version of a problem. The only difference between an easy and a hard version is the constraints on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. Arthur is giving a lesson to his famous $$$2 n$$$ knights. Like any other students, they're sitting at the desks in pairs, but out of habit in a circle. The knight $$$2 i - 1$$$ is sitting at the desk with the knight $$$2 i$$$. Each knight has intelligence , which can be measured by an integer. Let's denote the intelligence of the $$$i$$$-th knight as $$$a_i$$$. Arthur wants the maximal difference in total intelligence over all pairs of desks to be as small as possible. More formally, he wants to minimize $$$\\max\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n} (a_{2 i - 1} + a_{2 i}) - \\min\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n} (a_{2 i - 1} + a_{2 i})$$$. However, the Code of Chivalry only allows swapping the opposite knights in the circle, i.e., Arthur can simultaneously perform $$$a_i := a_{i + n}$$$, $$$a_{i + n} := a_i$$$ for any $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. Arthur can make any number of such swaps. What is the best result he can achieve?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. It is followed by descriptions of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$$$) — the number of desks. The second line consists of $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the intelligence values of the knights. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100\\,000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing one integer — the minimal difference Arthur can achieve.",
