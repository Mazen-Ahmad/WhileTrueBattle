  "statement": "One can notice the following remarkable mathematical fact: the number $$$2025$$$ can be represented as $$$(20+25)^2$$$. You are given a year represented by a string $$$s$$$, consisting of exactly $$$4$$$ characters. Thus, leading zeros are allowed in the year representation. For example, \"0001\", \"0185\", \"1375\" are valid year representations. You need to express it in the form $$$(a + b)^2$$$, where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are non-negative integers , or determine that it is impossible. For example, if $$$s$$$ = \"0001\", you can choose $$$a = 0$$$, $$$b = 1$$$, and write the year as $$$(0 + 1)^2 = 1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases. The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$, consisting of exactly $$$4$$$ characters. Each character is a digit from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "On a separate line for each test case, output: Two numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$a, b \\ge 0$$$) such that $$$(a + b)^2 = s$$$, if they exist. If there are multiple suitable pairs, you may output any of them. The number $$$-1$$$ otherwise.",
