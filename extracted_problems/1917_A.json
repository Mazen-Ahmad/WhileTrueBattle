  "statement": "You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose any element $$$a_i$$$ from the array and change its value to any integer between $$$0$$$ and $$$a_i$$$ (inclusive). More formally, if $$$a_i < 0$$$, replace $$$a_i$$$ with any integer in $$$[a_i, 0]$$$, otherwise replace $$$a_i$$$ with any integer in $$$[0, a_i]$$$. Let $$$r$$$ be the minimum possible product of all the $$$a_i$$$ after performing the operation any number of times. Find the minimum number of operations required to make the product equal to $$$r$$$. Also, print one such shortest sequence of operations. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 500$$$) - the number of test cases. This is followed by their description. The first line of each test case contains the a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) â€” the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case: The first line must contain the minimum number of operations $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\leq k \\leq n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$k$$$ lines must contain two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$, which represent the $$$j$$$-th operation. That operation consists in replacing $$$a_i$$$ with $$$x$$$.",
