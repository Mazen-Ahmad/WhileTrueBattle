  "statement": "You're given an array consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You have to perform $$$n$$$ turns. Initially your score is $$$0$$$. On the $$$i$$$-th turn, you are allowed to leave the array as it is or swap any one pair of $$$2$$$ adjacent elements in the array and change exactly one of them to $$$0$$$(and leave the value of other element unchanged) after swapping. In either case(whether you swap or not), after this you add $$$a_i$$$ to your score. What's the maximum possible score you can get?",
