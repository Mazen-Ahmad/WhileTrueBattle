  "statement": "Lena is a beautiful girl who likes logical puzzles. As a gift for her birthday, Lena got a matrix puzzle! The matrix consists of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, and each cell is either black or white. The coordinates $$$(i,j)$$$ denote the cell which belongs to the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column for every $$$1\\leq i \\leq n$$$ and $$$1\\leq j \\leq m$$$. To solve the puzzle, Lena has to choose a cell that minimizes the Manhattan distance to the farthest black cell from the chosen cell. More formally, let there be $$$k \\ge 1$$$ black cells in the matrix with coordinates $$$(x_i,y_i)$$$ for every $$$1\\leq i \\leq k$$$. Lena should choose a cell $$$(a,b)$$$ that minimizes $$$$$$\\max_{i=1}^{k}(|a-x_i|+|b-y_i|).$$$$$$ As Lena has no skill, she asked you for help. Will you tell her the optimal cell to choose?",
  "inputFormat": "There are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 10\\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2\\leq n,m \\leq 1000$$$) — the dimensions of the matrix. The following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ characters each, each character is either ' W ' or ' B '. The $$$j$$$-th character in the $$$i$$$-th of these lines is ' W ' if the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ is white, and ' B ' if the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ is black. It is guaranteed that at least one black cell exists. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n\\cdot m$$$ does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the optimal cell $$$(a,b)$$$ to choose. If multiple answers exist, output any.",
