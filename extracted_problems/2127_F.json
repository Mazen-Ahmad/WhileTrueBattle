  "statement": "Hamid wrote $$$3014$$$ lines of code for the a+b problem and gave $$$10$$$ lines of it to Hamed; then the following problem came to Hamed's mind. You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. An array $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ is called snake if and only if all of the following conditions hold: All elements in $$$a$$$ are integers between $$$0$$$ and $$$m$$$; $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n = m$$$; $$$a_n=\\max\\left([a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]\\right)$$$. We define $$$f(a)$$$ as in the following pseudocode: function f(array a): pos := 1 res := 0 let nxt[x] be an array such that nxt[x] is the smallest index y such that y > x and a[y] > a[x], or undefined if no such y exists while pos < n: if a[pos] < a[n]: res += a[nxt[pos]] - a[pos] pos := nxt[pos] else: pos += 1 return res Find the sum of $$$f(a)$$$ over all snake arrays $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of a snake array and the sum of all elements in a snake array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of $$$f(a)$$$ over all snake arrays $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
