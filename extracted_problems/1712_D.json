  "statement": "— Do you have a wish? — I want people to stop gifting each other arrays. O_o and Another Young Boy An array of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ fell down on you from the skies, along with a positive integer $$$k \\le n$$$. You can apply the following operation at most $$$k$$$ times: Choose an index $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ and an integer $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$. Then do $$$a_i := x$$$ (assign $$$x$$$ to $$$a_i$$$). Then build a complete undirected weighted graph with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, where edge $$$(l, r)$$$ ($$$1 \\le l < r \\le n$$$) has weight $$$\\min(a_{l},a_{l+1},\\ldots,a_{r})$$$. You have to find the maximum possible diameter of the resulting graph after performing at most $$$k$$$ operations. The diameter of a graph is equal to $$$\\max\\limits_{1 \\le u < v \\le n}{\\operatorname{d}(u, v)}$$$, where $$$\\operatorname{d}(u, v)$$$ is the length of the shortest path between vertex $$$u$$$ and vertex $$$v$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print one integer — the maximum possible diameter of the graph after performing at most $$$k$$$ operations.",
