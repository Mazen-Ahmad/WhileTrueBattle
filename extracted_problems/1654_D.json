  "statement": "Alice's potion making professor gave the following assignment to his students: brew a potion using $$$n$$$ ingredients, such that the proportion of ingredient $$$i$$$ in the final potion is $$$r_i > 0$$$ (and $$$r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n = 1$$$). He forgot the recipe, and now all he remembers is a set of $$$n-1$$$ facts of the form, \"ingredients $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ should have a ratio of $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$\" (i.e., if $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ are the amounts of ingredient $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ in the potion respectively, then it must hold $$$a_i/a_j = x/y$$$), where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are positive integers. However, it is guaranteed that the set of facts he remembers is sufficient to uniquely determine the original values $$$r_i$$$. He decided that he will allow the students to pass the class as long as they submit a potion which satisfies all of the $$$n-1$$$ requirements (there may be many such satisfactory potions), and contains a positive integer amount of each ingredient. Find the minimum total amount of ingredients needed to make a potion which passes the class. As the result can be very large, you should print the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains four integers $$$i, j, x, y$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, $$$i\\not=j$$$, $$$1\\le x, y \\le n$$$) — ingredients $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ should have a ratio of $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$. It is guaranteed that the set of facts is sufficient to uniquely determine the original values $$$r_i$$$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the minimum total amount of ingredients needed to make a potion which passes the class, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
