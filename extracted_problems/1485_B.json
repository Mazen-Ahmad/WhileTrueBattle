  "statement": "Given a positive integer $$$k$$$, two arrays are called $$$k$$$-similar if: they are strictly increasing ; they have the same length; all their elements are positive integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$ (inclusive); they differ in exactly one position. You are given an integer $$$k$$$, a strictly increasing array $$$a$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries. For each query, you are given two integers $$$l_i \\leq r_i$$$. Your task is to find how many arrays $$$b$$$ exist, such that $$$b$$$ is $$$k$$$-similar to array $$$[a_{l_i},a_{l_i+1}\\ldots,a_{r_i}]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\leq n, q \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$n\\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$, the number of queries and number $$$k$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq k$$$). This array is strictly increasing — $$$a_1 < a_2 < \\ldots < a_n$$$. Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th of them should contain the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query.",
