  "statement": "You have an array of zeros $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can perform two types of operations on it: Choose an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ and $$$a_i = 0$$$, and assign $$$1$$$ to $$$a_i$$$; Choose a pair of indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, $$$a_l = 1$$$, $$$a_r = 1$$$, $$$a_l + \\ldots + a_r \\ge \\lceil\\frac{r - l + 1}{2}\\rceil$$$, and assign $$$1$$$ to $$$a_i$$$ for all $$$l \\le i \\le r$$$. What is the minimum number of operations of the first type needed to make all elements of the array equal to one?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. Note that there is no limit on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of needed operations of first type .",
