  "statement": "Before becoming a successful trader William got a university degree. During his education an interesting situation happened, after which William started to listen to homework assignments much more attentively. What follows is a formal description of the homework assignment as William heard it: You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ only consisting of characters \" a \", \" b \" and \" c \". There are $$$q$$$ queries of format ($$$pos, c$$$), meaning replacing the element of string $$$s$$$ at position $$$pos$$$ with character $$$c$$$. After each query you must output the minimal number of characters in the string, which have to be replaced, so that the string doesn't contain string \" abc \" as a subsequence . A valid replacement of a character is replacing it with \" a \", \" b \" or \" c \". A string $$$x$$$ is said to be a subsequence of string $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deleting some characters without changing the ordering of the remaining characters.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ $$$(1 \\le n, q \\le 10^5)$$$, the length of the string and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of characters \" a \", \" b \" and \" c \". Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains an integer $$$i$$$ and character $$$c$$$ $$$(1 \\le i \\le n)$$$, index and the value of the new item in the string, respectively. It is guaranteed that character's $$$c$$$ value is \" a \", \" b \" or \" c \".",
  "outputFormat": "For each query output the minimal number of characters that would have to be replaced so that the string doesn't contain \" abc \" as a subsequence.",
