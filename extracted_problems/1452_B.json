  "statement": "You are asked to watch your nephew who likes to play with toy blocks in a strange way. He has $$$n$$$ boxes and the $$$i$$$-th box has $$$a_i$$$ blocks. His game consists of two steps: he chooses an arbitrary box $$$i$$$; he tries to move all blocks from the $$$i$$$-th box to other boxes. If he can make the same number of blocks in each of $$$n - 1$$$ other boxes then he will be happy, otherwise, will be sad. Note that your nephew can only move the blocks from the chosen box to the other boxes; he cannot move blocks from the other boxes. You don't want to make your nephew sad, so you decided to put several extra blocks into some boxes in such a way that no matter which box $$$i$$$ he chooses he won't be sad. What is the minimum number of extra blocks you need to put?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of boxes. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of blocks in each box. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of blocks you need to put. It can be proved that the answer always exists, i. e. the number of blocks is finite.",
