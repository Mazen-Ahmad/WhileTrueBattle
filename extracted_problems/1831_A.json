  "statement": "You are given a permutation$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Find any permutation $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$a_1+b_1 \\le a_2+b_2 \\le a_3+b_3 \\le \\ldots \\le a_n+b_n$$$. It can be proven that a permutation $$$b$$$ that satisfies the condition above always exists. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of permutations $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of permutation $$$a$$$. All elements of $$$a$$$ are distinct. Note that there is no bound on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output any permutation $$$b$$$ which satisfies the constraints mentioned in the statement. It can be proven that a permutation $$$b$$$ that satisfies the condition above always exists.",
