  "statement": "Hossam woke up bored, so he decided to create an interesting array with his friend Hazem. Now, they have an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers, Hossam will choose a number $$$a_i$$$ and Hazem will choose a number $$$a_j$$$. Count the number of interesting pairs $$$(a_i, a_j)$$$ that meet all the following conditions: $$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$; $$$i \\neq j$$$; The absolute difference $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$ must be equal to the maximum absolute difference over all the pairs in the array. More formally, $$$|a_i - a_j| = \\max_{1 \\le p, q \\le n} |a_p - a_q|$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$), which denotes the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print an integer â€” the number of interesting pairs $$$(a_i, a_j)$$$.",
