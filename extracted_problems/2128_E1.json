  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version, you are asked to find a subarray only for the maximum submedian . You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. An integer $$$v$$$ is a median of an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ if and only if: $$$v$$$ is greater than or equal to at least $$$\\lceil \\frac{m}{2} \\rceil$$$ elements of the array, and $$$v$$$ is less than or equal to at least $$$\\lceil \\frac{m}{2} \\rceil$$$ elements of the array. For instance: the only median of $$$[9, 3, 7]$$$ is $$$7$$$, the medians of $$$[5, 3, 7, 9]$$$ are $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$7$$$, and the only median of $$$[2, 2, 2]$$$ is $$$2$$$. You're given an integer $$$k$$$ and an array $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$. An integer $$$v$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is said to be a submedian if there exists at least one pair of indices $$$(l, r)$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$, $$$r - l + 1 \\geq k$$$, $$$v$$$ is a median of the subarray $$$[a_l, \\ldots, a_r]$$$. It can be proven that there always exists at least one submedian . Find the maximum submedian $$$v_\\max$$$ and any corresponding pair of indices $$$(l, r)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 50\\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 300\\,000$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$300\\,000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output three integers $$$v_\\max$$$, $$$l$$$, and $$$r$$$ â€” the maximum submedian $$$v_\\max$$$ and the bounds of a subarray of length at least $$$k$$$ ($$$r - l + 1 \\geq k$$$) such that $$$v_\\max$$$ is one of its medians . If there are many solutions, you can print any of them.",
