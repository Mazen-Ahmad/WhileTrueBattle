  "statement": "For his birthday recently Fedya was given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers arranged in a circle, For each pair of neighboring numbers ($$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_{n - 1}$$$ and $$$a_n$$$, $$$a_n$$$ and $$$a_1$$$) the absolute difference between them is equal to $$$1$$$. Let's call a local maximum an element, which is greater than both of its neighboring elements. Also call a local minimum an element, which is less than both of its neighboring elements. Note, that elements $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_n$$$ are neighboring elements. Unfortunately, Fedya lost an array, but he remembered in it the sum of local maximums $$$x$$$ and the sum of local minimums $$$y$$$. Given $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, help Fedya find any matching array of minimum length.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows. Each line of each test case contain two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$-10^{9} \\le y < x \\le 10^{9}$$$) — the sum of local maximums and the sum of local minimums, respectively.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, in the first line print one integer $$$n$$$ — the minimum length of matching arrays. In the second line print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^{9} \\leqslant a_i \\leqslant 10^{9}$$$) — the array elements such that the the absolute difference between each pair of neighboring is equal to $$$1$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
