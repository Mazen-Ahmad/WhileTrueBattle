  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ nonnegative integers. You can swap the elements at positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ if $$$a_i~\\mathsf{XOR}~a_j < 4$$$, where $$$\\mathsf{XOR}$$$ is the bitwise XOR operation . Find the lexicographically smallest array that can be made with any number of swaps. An array $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $$$y$$$ if in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, $$$x_i < y_i$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers — the lexicographically smallest array that can be made with any number of swaps.",
