  "statement": "On an $$$8 \\times 8$$$ grid of dots, a word consisting of lowercase Latin letters is written vertically in one column, from top to bottom. What is it?",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of $$$8$$$ lines, each containing $$$8$$$ characters. Each character in the grid is either $$$\\texttt{.}$$$ (representing a dot) or a lowercase Latin letter ($$$\\texttt{a}$$$–$$$\\texttt{z}$$$). The word lies entirely in a single column and is continuous from the beginning to the ending (without gaps). See the sample input for better understanding.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing the word made up of lowercase Latin letters ($$$\\texttt{a}$$$–$$$\\texttt{z}$$$) that is written vertically in one column from top to bottom.",
