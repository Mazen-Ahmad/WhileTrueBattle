  "statement": "Let's consider a game in which two players, A and B, participate. This game is characterized by two positive integers, $$$X$$$ and $$$Y$$$. The game consists of sets , and each set consists of plays . In each play , exactly one of the players, either A or B, wins. A set ends exactly when one of the players reaches $$$X$$$ wins in the plays of that set . This player is declared the winner of the set . The players play sets until one of them reaches $$$Y$$$ wins in the sets . After that, the game ends, and this player is declared the winner of the entire game. You have just watched a game but didn't notice who was declared the winner. You remember that during the game, $$$n$$$ plays were played, and you know which player won each play . However, you do not know the values of $$$X$$$ and $$$Y$$$. Based on the available information, determine who won the entire game — A or B. If there is not enough information to determine the winner, you should also report it.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4)$$$ - the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n \\leq 20)$$$ - the number of plays played during the game. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters $$$\\texttt{A}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{B}$$$. If $$$s_i = \\texttt{A}$$$, it means that player A won the $$$i$$$-th play . If $$$s_i = \\texttt{B}$$$, it means that player B won the $$$i$$$-th play . It is guaranteed that the given sequence of plays corresponds to at least one valid game scenario, for some values of $$$X$$$ and $$$Y$$$ .",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output: $$$\\texttt{A}$$$ — if player A is guaranteed to be the winner of the game. $$$\\texttt{B}$$$ — if player B is guaranteed to be the winner of the game. $$$\\texttt{?}$$$ — if it is impossible to determine the winner of the game.",
