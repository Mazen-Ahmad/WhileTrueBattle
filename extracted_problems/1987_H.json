  "statement": "This temple only magnifies the mountain's power. Badeline This is an interactive problem. You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$\\bf{n \\le m}$$$). The jury has hidden from you a rectangular matrix $$$a$$$ with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, where $$$a_{i,j} \\in \\{ -1, 0, 1 \\}$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ and $$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$. The jury has also selected a cell $$$(i_0, j_0)$$$. Your goal is to find $$$(i_0,j_0)$$$. In one query, you give a cell $$$(i, j)$$$, then the jury will reply with an integer. If $$$(i, j) = (i_0, j_0)$$$, the jury will reply with $$$0$$$. Else, let $$$S$$$ be the sum of $$$a_{x,y}$$$ over all $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$\\min(i, i_0) \\le x \\le \\max(i, i_0)$$$ and $$$\\min(j, j_0) \\le y \\le \\max(j, j_0)$$$. Then, the jury will reply with $$$|i - i_0| + |j - j_0| + |S|$$$. Find $$$(i_0, j_0)$$$ by making at most $$$n + 225$$$ queries. Note: the grader is not adaptive : $$$a$$$ and $$$(i_0,j_0)$$$ are fixed before any queries are made.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 50$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le m \\le 5000$$$) — the numbers of rows and the number of columns of the hidden matrix $$$a$$$ respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$25 \\cdot 10^6$$$.",
