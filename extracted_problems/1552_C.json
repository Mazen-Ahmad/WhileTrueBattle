  "statement": "On a circle lie $$$2n$$$ distinct points, with the following property: however you choose $$$3$$$ chords that connect $$$3$$$ disjoint pairs of points, no point strictly inside the circle belongs to all $$$3$$$ chords. The points are numbered $$$1, \\, 2, \\, \\dots, \\, 2n$$$ in clockwise order. Initially, $$$k$$$ chords connect $$$k$$$ pairs of points, in such a way that all the $$$2k$$$ endpoints of these chords are distinct. You want to draw $$$n - k$$$ additional chords that connect the remaining $$$2(n - k)$$$ points (each point must be an endpoint of exactly one chord). In the end, let $$$x$$$ be the total number of intersections among all $$$n$$$ chords. Compute the maximum value that $$$x$$$ can attain if you choose the $$$n - k$$$ chords optimally. Note that the exact position of the $$$2n$$$ points is not relevant, as long as the property stated in the first paragraph holds.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$, $$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$) — half the number of points and the number of chords initially drawn. Then $$$k$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, \\, y_i \\le 2n$$$, $$$x_i \\ne y_i$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th chord. It is guaranteed that the $$$2k$$$ numbers $$$x_1, \\, y_1, \\, x_2, \\, y_2, \\, \\dots, \\, x_k, \\, y_k$$$ are all distinct.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum number of intersections that can be obtained by drawing $$$n - k$$$ additional chords.",
