  "statement": "While exploring the jungle, you have bumped into a rare orangutan with a bow tie! You shake hands with the orangutan and offer him some food and water. In return... The orangutan has gifted you an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Using $$$a$$$, you will construct two arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$, both containing $$$n$$$ elements, in the following manner: $$$b_i = \\min(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_i)$$$ for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. $$$c_i = \\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_i)$$$ for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$. Define the score of $$$a$$$ as $$$\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i - b_i$$$ (i.e. the sum of $$$c_i - b_i$$$ over all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$). Before you calculate the score , you can shuffle the elements of $$$a$$$ however you want. Find the maximum score that you can get if you shuffle the elements of $$$a$$$ optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$. The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 1000$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum score that you can get.",
