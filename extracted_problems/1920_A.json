  "statement": "Alex is solving a problem. He has $$$n$$$ constraints on what the integer $$$k$$$ can be. There are three types of constraints: $$$k$$$ must be greater than or equal to some integer $$$x$$$; $$$k$$$ must be less than or equal to some integer $$$x$$$; $$$k$$$ must be not equal to some integer $$$x$$$. Help Alex find the number of integers $$$k$$$ that satisfy all $$$n$$$ constraints. It is guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of type $$$1$$$ and at least one constraint of type $$$2$$$). Also, it is guaranteed that no two constraints are the exact same .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the number of constraints. The following $$$n$$$ lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$a \\in \\{1,2,3\\}, \\, 1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$$$). $$$a$$$ denotes the type of constraint. If $$$a=1$$$, $$$k$$$ must be greater than or equal to $$$x$$$. If $$$a=2$$$, $$$k$$$ must be less than or equal to $$$x$$$. If $$$a=3$$$, $$$k$$$ must be not equal to $$$x$$$. It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all $$$n$$$ constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type $$$1$$$ and at least one constraint of type $$$2$$$). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the exact same (in other words, all pairs $$$(a, x)$$$ are distinct).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers $$$k$$$ that satisfy all $$$n$$$ constraints.",
