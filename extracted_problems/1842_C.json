  "statement": "Enjoy erasing Tenzing, identified as Accepted! Tenzing has $$$n$$$ balls arranged in a line. The color of the $$$i$$$-th ball from the left is $$$a_i$$$. Tenzing can do the following operation any number of times: select $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$1\\leq i < j \\leq |a|$$$ and $$$a_i=a_j$$$, remove $$$a_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_j$$$ from the array (and decrease the indices of all elements to the right of $$$a_j$$$ by $$$j-i+1$$$). Tenzing wants to know the maximum number of balls he can remove.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of balls. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the color of the balls. It is guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ of all test cases will not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum number of balls Tenzing can remove.",
