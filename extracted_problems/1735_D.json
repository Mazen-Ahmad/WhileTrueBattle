  "statement": "You like the card board game \"Set\". Each card contains $$$k$$$ features, each of which is equal to a value from the set $$$\\{0, 1, 2\\}$$$. The deck contains all possible variants of cards, that is, there are $$$3^k$$$ different cards in total. A feature for three cards is called good if it is the same for these cards or pairwise distinct. Three cards are called a set if all $$$k$$$ features are good for them. For example, the cards $$$(0, 0, 0)$$$, $$$(0, 2, 1)$$$, and $$$(0, 1, 2)$$$ form a set, but the cards $$$(0, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 1, 2)$$$, and $$$(1, 2, 0)$$$ do not, as, for example, the last feature is not good. A group of five cards is called a meta-set , if there is strictly more than one set among them. How many meta-sets there are among given $$$n$$$ distinct cards?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^3$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 20$$$) — the number of cards on a table and the number of card features. The description of the cards follows in the next $$$n$$$ lines. Each line describing a card contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$c_{i, 1}, c_{i, 2}, \\ldots, c_{i, k}$$$ ($$$0 \\le c_{i, j} \\le 2$$$) — card features. It is guaranteed that all cards are distinct.",
