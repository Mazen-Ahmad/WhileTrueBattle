  "statement": "oolimry has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ which he really likes. Today, you have changed his array to $$$b$$$, a permutation of $$$a$$$, to make him sad. Because oolimry is only a duck, he can only perform the following operation to restore his array: Choose two integers $$$i,j$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq i,j \\leq n$$$. Swap $$$b_i$$$ and $$$b_j$$$. The sadness of the array $$$b$$$ is the minimum number of operations needed to transform $$$b$$$ into $$$a$$$. Given the arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, where $$$b$$$ is a permutation of $$$a$$$, determine if $$$b$$$ has the maximum sadness over all permutations of $$$a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$b$$$ is a permutation of $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \" AC \" (without quotes) if $$$b$$$ has the maximum sadness over all permutations of $$$a$$$, and \" WA \" (without quotes) otherwise.",
