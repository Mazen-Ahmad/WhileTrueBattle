  "statement": "Alice and Bob are playing a game on $$$n$$$ piles of stones. On each player's turn, they select a positive integer $$$k$$$ that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and remove $$$k$$$ stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses. Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play optimally?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of piles in the game. The next line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the initial number of stones in the $$$i$$$-th pile. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print \" Alice \", otherwise print \" Bob \" (without quotes).",
