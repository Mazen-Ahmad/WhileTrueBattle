  "statement": "You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (a string that consists only of $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$). A number $$$x$$$ is good if there exists a binary string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$, containing $$$x$$$ ones, such that if each symbol $$$s_i$$$ is replaced by $$$s_i \\oplus l_i$$$ (where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation ), then the string $$$s$$$ becomes a palindrome. You need to output a binary string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n+1$$$, where $$$t_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) is equal to $$$1$$$ if number $$$i$$$ is good, and $$$0$$$ otherwise. A palindrome is a string that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example, 01010 , 1111 , 0110 are palindromes.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing a binary string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n+1$$$ - the answer to the problem.",
