  "statement": "Alice and Bob came up with a rather strange game. They have an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n$$$. Alice chooses a certain integer $$$k$$$ and tells it to Bob, then the following happens: Bob chooses two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$), and then finds the maximum among the integers $$$a_i, a_{i + 1},\\ldots, a_j$$$; If the obtained maximum is strictly greater than $$$k$$$, Alice wins, otherwise Bob wins. Help Alice find the maximum $$$k$$$ at which she is guaranteed to win.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of elements in the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the maximum integer $$$k$$$ at which Alice is guaranteed to win.",
