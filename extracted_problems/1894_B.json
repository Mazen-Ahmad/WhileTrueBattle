  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. You need to find an array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ consisting of numbers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ such that exactly two out of the following three conditions are satisfied: There exist indices $$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$ such that $$$a_i = a_j$$$, $$$b_i = 1$$$, $$$b_j = 2$$$. There exist indices $$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$ such that $$$a_i = a_j$$$, $$$b_i = 1$$$, $$$b_j = 3$$$. There exist indices $$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$ such that $$$a_i = a_j$$$, $$$b_i = 2$$$, $$$b_j = 3$$$. If such an array does not exist, you should report it.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 500)$$$ — the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n \\leq 100)$$$ — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq a_i \\leq 100)$$$ — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print -1 if there is no solution. Otherwise, print $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ — an array consisting of numbers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ that satisfies exactly two out of three conditions. If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them.",
