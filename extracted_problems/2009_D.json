  "statement": "Satyam is given $$$n$$$ distinct points on the 2D coordinate plane. It is guaranteed that $$$0 \\leq y_i \\leq 1$$$ for all given points $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. How many different nondegenerate right triangles$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ can be formed from choosing three different points as its vertices? Two triangles $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are different if there is a point $$$v$$$ such that $$$v$$$ is a vertex of $$$a$$$ but not a vertex of $$$b$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A nondegenerate right triangle has positive area and an interior $$$90^{\\circ}$$$ angle.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of points. The following $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq y_i \\leq 1$$$) — the $$$i$$$'th point that Satyam can choose from. It is guaranteed that all $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ are pairwise distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Output an integer for each test case, the number of distinct nondegenerate right triangles that can be formed from choosing three points.",
