  "statement": "On the board, Bob wrote $$$n$$$ positive integers in base $$$10$$$ with sum $$$s$$$ (i. e. in decimal numeral system). Alice sees the board, but accidentally interprets the numbers on the board as base-$$$11$$$ integers and adds them up (in base $$$11$$$). What numbers should Bob write on the board, so Alice's sum is as large as possible?",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$s$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s \\leq 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\leq n \\leq \\min(100, s)$$$) — the sum and amount of numbers on the board, respectively. Numbers $$$s$$$ and $$$n$$$ are given in decimal notation (base $$$10$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ positive integers — the numbers Bob should write on the board, so Alice's sum is as large as possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
