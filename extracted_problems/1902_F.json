  "statement": "You are given a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. There is an integer written on each vertex; the $$$i$$$-th vertex has integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it. You have to process $$$q$$$ queries. The $$$i$$$-th query consists of three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and $$$k_i$$$. For this query, you have to answer if it is possible to choose a set of vertices $$$v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_m$$$ (possibly empty) such that: every vertex $$$v_j$$$ is on the simple path between $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ (endpoints can be used as well); $$$a_{v_1} \\oplus a_{v_2} \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_{v_m} = k_i$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 2^{20} - 1$$$). Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follow. Each of them contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$; $$$u \\ne v$$$) denoting an edge of the tree. The next line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of queries. Then $$$q$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$; $$$0 \\le k_i \\le 2^{20} - 1$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print YES if it is possible to form a set of vertices meeting the constraints. Otherwise, print NO . You can print each letter in any case.",
