  "statement": "On an endless checkered sheet of paper, $$$n$$$ cells are chosen and colored in three colors, where $$$n$$$ is divisible by $$$3$$$. It turns out that there are exactly $$$\\frac{n}{3}$$$ marked cells of each of three colors! Find the largest such $$$k$$$ that it's possible to choose $$$\\frac{k}{3}$$$ cells of each color, remove all other marked cells, and then select three rectangles with sides parallel to the grid lines so that the following conditions hold: No two rectangles can intersect (but they can share a part of the boundary). In other words, the area of intersection of any two of these rectangles must be $$$0$$$. The $$$i$$$-th rectangle contains all the chosen cells of the $$$i$$$-th color and no chosen cells of other colors, for $$$i = 1, 2, 3$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ — the number of the marked cells ($$$3 \\leq n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$n$$$ is divisible by 3). The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$ ($$$|x_i|,|y_i| \\leq 10^9$$$; $$$1 \\leq c_i \\leq 3$$$), where $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ are the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th marked cell and $$$c_i$$$ is its color. It's guaranteed that all cells $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ in the input are distinct, and that there are exactly $$$\\frac{n}{3}$$$ cells of each color.",
