  "statement": "You are a cat selling fun algorithm problems. Today, you want to recommend your fun algorithm problems to $$$k$$$ cities. There are a total of $$$n$$$ cities, each with two parameters $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. Between any two cities $$$i,j$$$ ($$$i\\ne j$$$), there is a bidirectional road with a length of $$$\\max(a_i + b_j , b_i + a_j)$$$. The cost of a path is defined as the total length of roads between every two adjacent cities along the path. For $$$k=2,3,\\ldots,n$$$, find the minimum cost among all simple paths containing exactly $$$k$$$ distinct cities.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1500$$$) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 3\\cdot 10^3$$$) — the number of cities. Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$a_i,b_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i,b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the parameters of city $$$i$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$9\\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$n-1$$$ integers in one line. The $$$i$$$-th integer represents the minimum cost when $$$k=i+1$$$.",
