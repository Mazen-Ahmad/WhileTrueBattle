  "statement": "You have a connected undirected graph made of $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$ edges. The $$$i$$$-th node has a value $$$v_i$$$ and a target value $$$t_i$$$. In an operation, you can choose an edge $$$(i, j)$$$ and add $$$k$$$ to both $$$v_i$$$ and $$$v_j$$$, where $$$k$$$ can be any integer . In particular, $$$k$$$ can be negative. Your task to determine if it is possible that by doing some finite number of operations (possibly zero), you can achieve for every node $$$i$$$, $$$v_i = t_i$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$), the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n-1\\leq m\\leq \\min(2\\cdot 10^5, \\frac{n(n-1)}{2})$$$) — the number of nodes and edges respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$v_1\\ldots, v_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq v_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — initial values of nodes. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$t_1\\ldots, t_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq t_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — target values of nodes. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ representing an edge between node $$$i$$$ and node $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$, $$$i\\ne j$$$). It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and there is at most one edge between the same pair of nodes. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is possible for every node to reach its target after some number of operations, print \" YES \". Otherwise, print \" NO \".",
