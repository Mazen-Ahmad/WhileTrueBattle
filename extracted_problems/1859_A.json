  "statement": "Given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, containing integers. And there are two initially empty arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$. You need to add each element of array $$$a$$$ to exactly one of the arrays $$$b$$$ or $$$c$$$, in order to satisfy the following conditions: Both arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are non-empty. More formally, let $$$l_b$$$ be the length of array $$$b$$$, and $$$l_c$$$ be the length of array $$$c$$$. Then $$$l_b, l_c \\ge 1$$$. For any two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le l_b, 1 \\le j \\le l_c$$$), $$$c_j$$$ is not a divisor of $$$b_i$$$. Output the arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ that can be obtained, or output $$$-1$$$ if they do not exist.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer $$$-1$$$ if a solution does not exist. Otherwise, in the first line, output two integers $$$l_b$$$ and $$$l_c$$$ — the lengths of arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ respectively. In the second line, output $$$l_b$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{l_b}$$$ — the elements of array $$$b$$$. In the third line, output $$$l_c$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_{l_c}$$$ — the elements of array $$$c$$$. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them. You can output the elements of the arrays in any order.",
