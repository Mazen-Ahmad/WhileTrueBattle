  "statement": "Given $$$n$$$, find any array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of integers such that all of the following conditions hold: $$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$ for every $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. $$$a_1 < a_2 < \\ldots <a_n$$$ For every $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$n$$$, $$$a_i$$$ isn't divisible by $$$a_{i-1}$$$ It can be shown that such an array always exists under the constraints of the problem.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ â€” the array you found. If there are multiple arrays satisfying all the conditions, print any of them.",
