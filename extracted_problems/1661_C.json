  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ trees in a park, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The initial height of the $$$i$$$-th tree is $$$h_i$$$. You want to water these trees, so they all grow to the same height. The watering process goes as follows. You start watering trees at day $$$1$$$. During the $$$j$$$-th day you can: Choose a tree and water it. If the day is odd (e.g. $$$1, 3, 5, 7, \\dots$$$), then the height of the tree increases by $$$1$$$. If the day is even (e.g. $$$2, 4, 6, 8, \\dots$$$), then the height of the tree increases by $$$2$$$. Or skip a day without watering any tree. Note that you can't water more than one tree in a day. Your task is to determine the minimum number of days required to water the trees so they grow to the same height. You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of trees. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le h_i \\le 10^9$$$), where $$$h_i$$$ is the height of the $$$i$$$-th tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\sum n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of days required to water the trees, so they grow to the same height.",
