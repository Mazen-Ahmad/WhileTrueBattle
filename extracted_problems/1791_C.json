  "statement": "Timur initially had a binary string$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ $$$s$$$ (possibly of length $$$0$$$). He performed the following operation several (possibly zero) times: Add $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ to one end of the string and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$ to the other end of the string. For example, starting from the string $$$\\texttt{1011}$$$, you can obtain either $$$\\color{red}{\\texttt{0}}\\texttt{1011}\\color{red}{\\texttt{1}}$$$ or $$$\\color{red}{\\texttt{1}}\\texttt{1011}\\color{red}{\\texttt{0}}$$$. You are given Timur's final string. What is the length of the shortest possible string he could have started with? $$$^{\\dagger}$$$ A binary string is a string (possibly the empty string) whose characters are either $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ or $$$\\texttt{1}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2000$$$) — the length of Timur's final string. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ or $$$\\texttt{1}$$$, denoting the final string.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single nonnegative integer — the shortest possible length of Timur's original string. Note that Timur's original string could have been empty, in which case you should output $$$0$$$.",
