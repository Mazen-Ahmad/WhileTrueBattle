  "statement": "Qingshan has a string $$$s$$$ which only contains $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$. A string $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ is good if and only if $$$a_i \\ne a_{k-i+1}$$$ for all $$$i=1,2,\\ldots,k$$$. For Div. 2 contestants, note that this condition is different from the condition in problem B. For example, $$$\\texttt{10}$$$, $$$\\texttt{1010}$$$, $$$\\texttt{111000}$$$ are good, while $$$\\texttt{11}$$$, $$$\\texttt{101}$$$, $$$\\texttt{001}$$$, $$$\\texttt{001100}$$$ are not good. Qingshan wants to make $$$s$$$ good. To do this, she can do the following operation at most $$$300$$$ times (possibly, zero): insert $$$\\texttt{01}$$$ to any position of $$$s$$$ (getting a new $$$s$$$). Please tell Qingshan if it is possible to make $$$s$$$ good. If it is possible, print a sequence of operations that makes $$$s$$$ good.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n\\le 100$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$, respectively. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ with length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$s$$$ only consists of $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{1}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it impossible to make $$$s$$$ good, output $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output $$$p$$$ ($$$0 \\le p \\le 300$$$) — the number of operations, in the first line. Then, output $$$p$$$ integers in the second line. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be an index $$$x_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le x_i \\le n+2i-2$$$) — the position where you want to insert $$$\\texttt{01}$$$ in the current $$$s$$$. If $$$x_i=0$$$, you insert $$$\\texttt{01}$$$ at the beginning of $$$s$$$. Otherwise, you insert $$$\\texttt{01}$$$ immediately after the $$$x_i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$. We can show that under the constraints in this problem, if an answer exists, there is always an answer that requires at most $$$300$$$ operations.",
