  "statement": "For a certain permutation $$$p$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ Sakurako calls an integer $$$j$$$ reachable from an integer $$$i$$$ if it is possible to make $$$i$$$ equal to $$$j$$$ by assigning $$$i=p_i$$$ a certain number of times. If $$$p=[3,5,6,1,2,4]$$$, then, for example, $$$4$$$ is reachable from $$$1$$$, because: $$$i=1$$$ $$$\\rightarrow$$$ $$$i=p_1=3$$$ $$$\\rightarrow$$$ $$$i=p_3=6$$$ $$$\\rightarrow$$$ $$$i=p_6=4$$$. Now $$$i=4$$$, so $$$4$$$ is reachable from $$$1$$$. Each number in the permutation is colored either black or white. Sakurako defines the function $$$F(i)$$$ as the number of black integers that are reachable from $$$i$$$. Sakurako is interested in $$$F(i)$$$ for each $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$, but calculating all values becomes very difficult, so she asks you, as her good friend, to compute this. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation (the number $$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$, but the array contains $$$4$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1\\le p_i\\le n$$$) — the elements of the permutation. The third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of '0' and '1'. If $$$s_i=0$$$, then the number $$$p_i$$$ is colored black; if $$$s_i=1$$$, then the number $$$p_i$$$ is colored white. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$F(1), F(2), \\dots, F(n)$$$.",
