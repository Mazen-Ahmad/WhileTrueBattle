  "statement": "One day Masha was walking in the park and found a graph under a tree... Surprised? Did you think that this problem would have some logical and reasoned story? No way! So, the problem... Masha has an oriented graph which $$$i$$$-th vertex contains some positive integer $$$a_i$$$. Initially Masha can put a coin at some vertex. In one operation she can move a coin placed in some vertex $$$u$$$ to any other vertex $$$v$$$ such that there is an oriented edge $$$u \\to v$$$ in the graph. Each time when the coin is placed in some vertex $$$i$$$, Masha write down an integer $$$a_i$$$ in her notebook (in particular, when Masha initially puts a coin at some vertex, she writes an integer written at this vertex in her notebook). Masha wants to make exactly $$$k - 1$$$ operations in such way that the maximum number written in her notebook is as small as possible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the number of operation that Masha should make. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the numbers written in graph vertices. Each of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u \\ne v \\le n$$$) — it means that there is an edge $$$u \\to v$$$ in the graph. It's guaranteed that graph doesn't contain loops and multi-edges.",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer — the minimum value of the maximum number that Masha wrote in her notebook during optimal coin movements. If Masha won't be able to perform $$$k - 1$$$ operations, print $$$-1$$$.",
