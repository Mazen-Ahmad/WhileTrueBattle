  "statement": "You are given a pair of integers $$$(a, b)$$$ and an integer $$$x$$$. You can change the pair in two different ways: set (assign) $$$a := |a - b|$$$; set (assign) $$$b := |a - b|$$$, where $$$|a - b|$$$ is the absolute difference between $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is called $$$x$$$-magic if $$$x$$$ is obtainable either as $$$a$$$ or as $$$b$$$ using only the given operations (i.e. the pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is $$$x$$$-magic if $$$a = x$$$ or $$$b = x$$$ after some number of operations applied). You can apply the operations any number of times (even zero). Your task is to find out if the pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is $$$x$$$-magic or not. You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases. The only line of the test case contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b, x \\le 10^{18}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For the $$$i$$$-th test case, print YES if the corresponding pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is $$$x$$$-magic and NO otherwise.",
