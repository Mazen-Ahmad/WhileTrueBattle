  "statement": "There is a tale about the wise King Keykhosrow who owned a grand treasury filled with treasures from across the Persian Empire. However, to prevent theft and ensure the safety of his wealth, King Keykhosrow's vault was sealed with a magical lock that could only be opened by solving a riddle. The riddle involves two sacred numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. To unlock the vault, the challenger must determine the smallest key number $$$m$$$ that satisfies two conditions: $$$m$$$ must be greater than or equal to at least one of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The remainder when $$$m$$$ is divided by $$$a$$$ must be equal to the remainder when $$$m$$$ is divided by $$$b$$$. Only by finding the smallest correct value of $$$m$$$ can one unlock the vault and access the legendary treasures!",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq 1000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the smallest integer $$$m$$$ that satisfies the conditions above.",
