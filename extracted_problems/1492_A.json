  "statement": "Three swimmers decided to organize a party in the swimming pool! At noon, they started to swim from the left side of the pool. It takes the first swimmer exactly $$$a$$$ minutes to swim across the entire pool and come back, exactly $$$b$$$ minutes for the second swimmer and $$$c$$$ minutes for the third. Hence, the first swimmer will be on the left side of the pool after $$$0$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$2a$$$, $$$3a$$$, ... minutes after the start time, the second one will be at $$$0$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$2b$$$, $$$3b$$$, ... minutes, and the third one will be on the left side of the pool after $$$0$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$2c$$$, $$$3c$$$, ... minutes. You came to the left side of the pool exactly $$$p$$$ minutes after they started swimming. Determine how long you have to wait before one of the swimmers arrives at the left side of the pool.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Next $$$t$$$ lines contains test case descriptions, one per line. Each line contains four integers $$$p$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p, a, b, c \\leq 10^{18}$$$), time in minutes after the start, when you came to the pool and times in minutes it take the swimmers to cross the entire pool and come back.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — how long you have to wait (in minutes) before one of the swimmers arrives at the left side of the pool.",
