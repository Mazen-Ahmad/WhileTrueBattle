  "statement": "In order to test his patients' intelligence, Dr. TC created the following test. First, he creates a binary string$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$s$$$ having $$$n$$$ characters. Then, he creates $$$n$$$ binary strings $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. It is known that $$$a_i$$$ is created by first copying $$$s$$$, then flipping the $$$i$$$'th character ($$$\\texttt{1}$$$ becomes $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ and vice versa). After creating all $$$n$$$ strings, he arranges them into a grid where the $$$i$$$'th row is $$$a_i$$$. For example, If $$$s = \\texttt{101}$$$, $$$a = [\\texttt{001}, \\texttt{111}, \\texttt{100}]$$$. If $$$s = \\texttt{0000}$$$, $$$a = [\\texttt{1000}, \\texttt{0100}, \\texttt{0010}, \\texttt{0001}]$$$. The patient needs to count the number of $$$1$$$s written on the board in less than a second. Can you pass the test? $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A binary string is a string that only consists of characters $$$\\texttt{1}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{0}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input consists of a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10$$$) — the length of the binary string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a single binary string $$$s$$$ of size $$$n$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer, the number of $$$\\texttt{1}$$$s on the board.",
