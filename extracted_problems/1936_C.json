  "statement": "You are at a dueling arena. You also possess $$$n$$$ Pokémons. Initially, only the $$$1$$$-st Pokémon is standing in the arena. Each Pokémon has $$$m$$$ attributes. The $$$j$$$-th attribute of the $$$i$$$-th Pokémon is $$$a_{i,j}$$$. Each Pokémon also has a cost to be hired: the $$$i$$$-th Pokémon's cost is $$$c_i$$$. You want to have the $$$n$$$-th Pokémon stand in the arena. To do that, you can perform the following two types of operations any number of times in any order: Choose three integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$, $$$k > 0$$$), increase $$$a_{i,j}$$$ by $$$k$$$ permanently. The cost of this operation is $$$k$$$. Choose two integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$) and hire the $$$i$$$-th Pokémon to duel with the current Pokémon in the arena based on the $$$j$$$-th attribute. The $$$i$$$-th Pokémon will win if $$$a_{i,j}$$$ is greater than or equal to the $$$j$$$-th attribute of the current Pokémon in the arena (otherwise, it will lose). After the duel, only the winner will stand in the arena. The cost of this operation is $$$c_i$$$. Find the minimum cost you need to pay to have the $$$n$$$-th Pokémon stand in the arena.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 4 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 4 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i \\le 10^9$$$). The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\ldots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{i,j} \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum cost to make the $$$n$$$-th Pokémon stand in the arena.",
