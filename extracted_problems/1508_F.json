  "statement": "Touko's favorite sequence of numbers is a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ of $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$, and she wants some collection of permutations that are similar to her favorite permutation. She has a collection of $$$q$$$ intervals of the form $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ with $$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$. To create permutations that are similar to her favorite permutation, she coined the following definition: A permutation $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ allows an interval $$$[l', r']$$$ to holds its shape if for any pair of integers $$$(x, y)$$$ such that $$$l' \\le x < y \\le r'$$$, we have $$$b_x < b_y$$$ if and only if $$$a_x < a_y$$$. A permutation $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ is $$$k$$$-similar if $$$b$$$ allows all intervals $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le k$$$ to hold their shapes. Yuu wants to figure out all $$$k$$$-similar permutations for Touko, but it turns out this is a very hard task; instead, Yuu will encode the set of all $$$k$$$-similar permutations with directed acylic graphs (DAG). Yuu also coined the following definitions for herself: A permutation $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ satisfies a DAG $$$G'$$$ if for all edge $$$u \\to v$$$ in $$$G'$$$, we must have $$$b_u < b_v$$$. A $$$k$$$-encoding is a DAG $$$G_k$$$ on the set of vertices $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ such that a permutation $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ satisfies $$$G_k$$$ if and only if $$$b$$$ is $$$k$$$-similar. Since Yuu is free today, she wants to figure out the minimum number of edges among all $$$k$$$-encodings for each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$q$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 25\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\le q \\le 100\\,000$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ which form a permutation of $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$. ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$k$$$-th of them should contain a single integer â€” The minimum number of edges among all $$$k$$$-encodings.",
