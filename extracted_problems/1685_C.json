  "statement": "Alina has a bracket sequence $$$s$$$ of length $$$2n$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ opening brackets '(' and $$$n$$$ closing brackets ')' . As she likes balance, she wants to turn this bracket sequence into a balanced bracket sequence. In one operation, she can reverse any substring of $$$s$$$. What's the smallest number of operations that she needs to turn $$$s$$$ into a balanced bracket sequence? It can be shown that it's always possible in at most $$$n$$$ operations. As a reminder, a sequence of brackets is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters + and 1 . For example, sequences (())() , () , and (()(())) are balanced, while )( , (() , and (()))( are not.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$2n$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ opening and $$$n$$$ closing brackets. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, in the first line output a single integer $$$k$$$ $$$(0 \\le k \\le n)$$$ — the smallest number of operations required. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$k$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 2n$$$), indicating that in the $$$i$$$-th operation, Alina will reverse the substring $$$s_ls_{l+1} \\ldots s_{r-1}s_r$$$. Here the numeration starts from $$$1$$$. If there are multiple sequences of operations with the smallest length which transform the sequence into a balanced one, you can output any of them.",
