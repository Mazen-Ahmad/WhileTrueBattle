  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ cities located on a straight line. The cities are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Portals are used to move between cities. There are $$$4$$$ colors of portals: blue, green, red, and yellow. Each city has portals of two different colors. You can move from city $$$i$$$ to city $$$j$$$ if they have portals of the same color (for example, you can move between a \"blue-red\" city and a \"blue-green\" city). This movement costs $$$|i-j|$$$ coins. Your task is to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries: calculate the minimum cost to move from city $$$x$$$ to city $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of cities and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ strings of the following types: BG , BR , BY , GR , GY , or RY ; the $$$i$$$-th of them describes the portals located in the $$$i$$$-th city; the symbol B indicates that there is a blue portal in the city, G — green, R — red, and Y — yellow. The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_j$$$ and $$$y_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_j, y_j \\le n$$$) — the description of the $$$j$$$-th query. Additional constraints on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print a single integer — the minimum cost to move from city $$$x$$$ to city $$$y$$$ (or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible).",
