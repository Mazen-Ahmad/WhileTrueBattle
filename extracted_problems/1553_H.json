  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct elements and an integer $$$k$$$. Each element in the array is a non-negative integer not exceeding $$$2^k-1$$$. Let's define the XOR distance for a number $$$x$$$ as the value of $$$$$$f(x) = \\min\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \\min\\limits_{j = i + 1}^{n} |(a_i \\oplus x) - (a_j \\oplus x)|,$$$$$$ where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation . For every integer $$$x$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$2^k-1$$$, you have to calculate $$$f(x)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le 19$$$; $$$2 \\le n \\le 2^k$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 2^k-1$$$). All these integers are distinct.",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$2^k$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of them should be equal to $$$f(i-1)$$$.",
