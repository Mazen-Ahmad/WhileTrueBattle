  "statement": "Last summer, Feluda gifted Lalmohan-Babu a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$ of length $$$2 n$$$. Topshe was bored during his summer vacations, and hence he decided to draw an undirected graph of $$$2 n$$$ vertices using the balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$. For any two distinct vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < j \\le 2 n$$$), Topshe draws an edge (undirected and unweighted) between these two nodes if and only if the subsegment $$$s[i \\ldots j]$$$ forms a balanced bracket sequence. Determine the number of connected components in Topshe's graph. See the Notes section for definitions of the underlined terms.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of opening brackets in string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$2 n$$$ — a balanced bracket sequence consisting of $$$n$$$ opening brackets \" ( \", and $$$n$$$ closing brackets \" ) \". It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
