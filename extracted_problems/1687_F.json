  "statement": "As she closed the Satori's eye that could read minds, Koishi gained the ability to live in unconsciousness. Even she herself does not know what she is up to. â€” Subterranean Animism Koishi is unconsciously permuting $$$n$$$ numbers: $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. She thinks the permutation $$$p$$$ is beautiful if $$$s=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} [p_i+1=p_{i+1}]$$$. $$$[x]$$$ equals to $$$1$$$ if $$$x$$$ holds, or $$$0$$$ otherwise. For each $$$k\\in[0,n-1]$$$, she wants to know the number of beautiful permutations of length $$$n$$$ satisfying $$$k=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}[p_i<p_{i+1}]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "There is one line containing two intergers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 250\\,000$$$) and $$$s$$$ ($$$0 \\leq s < n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print one line with $$$n$$$ intergers. The $$$i$$$-th integers represents the answer of $$$k=i-1$$$, modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
