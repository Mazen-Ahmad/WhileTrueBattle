  "statement": "You have $$$5$$$ different types of coins, each with a value equal to one of the first $$$5$$$ triangular numbers: $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$10$$$, and $$$15$$$. These coin types are available in abundance. Your goal is to find the minimum number of these coins required such that their total value sums up to exactly $$$n$$$. We can show that the answer always exists.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$$$) — the target value.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single number — the minimum number of coins required.",
