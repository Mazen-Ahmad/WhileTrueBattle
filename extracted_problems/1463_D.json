  "statement": "You have $$$2n$$$ integers $$$1, 2, \\dots, 2n$$$. You have to redistribute these $$$2n$$$ elements into $$$n$$$ pairs. After that, you choose $$$x$$$ pairs and take minimum elements from them, and from the other $$$n - x$$$ pairs, you take maximum elements. Your goal is to obtain the set of numbers $$$\\{b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n\\}$$$ as the result of taking elements from the pairs. What is the number of different $$$x$$$-s ($$$0 \\le x \\le n$$$) such that it's possible to obtain the set $$$b$$$ if for each $$$x$$$ you can choose how to distribute numbers into pairs and from which $$$x$$$ pairs choose minimum elements?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_1 < b_2 < \\dots < b_n \\le 2n$$$) — the set you'd like to get. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one number — the number of different $$$x$$$-s such that it's possible to obtain the set $$$b$$$.",
