  "statement": "There is a string $$$a$$$ (unknown to you), consisting of lowercase Latin letters, encrypted according to the following rule into string $$$s$$$: after each character of string $$$a$$$, an arbitrary (possibly zero) number of any lowercase Latin letters, different from the character itself, is added; after each such addition, the character that we supplemented is added. You are given string $$$s$$$, and you need to output the initial string $$$a$$$. In other words, you need to decrypt string $$$s$$$. Note that each string encrypted in this way is decrypted uniquely .",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the encrypted message. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ — the encrypted message obtained from some string $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the decrypted message $$$a$$$ on a separate line.",
