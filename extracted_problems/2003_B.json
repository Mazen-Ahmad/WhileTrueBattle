  "statement": "Turtle and Piggy are playing a game on a sequence. They are given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, and Turtle goes first. Turtle and Piggy alternate in turns (so, Turtle does the first turn, Piggy does the second, Turtle does the third, etc.). The game goes as follows: Let the current length of the sequence be $$$m$$$. If $$$m = 1$$$, the game ends. If the game does not end and it's Turtle's turn, then Turtle must choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i \\le m - 1$$$, set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$\\max(a_i, a_{i + 1})$$$, and remove $$$a_{i + 1}$$$. If the game does not end and it's Piggy's turn, then Piggy must choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i \\le m - 1$$$, set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$\\min(a_i, a_{i + 1})$$$, and remove $$$a_{i + 1}$$$. Turtle wants to maximize the value of $$$a_1$$$ in the end, while Piggy wants to minimize the value of $$$a_1$$$ in the end. Find the value of $$$a_1$$$ in the end if both players play optimally. You can refer to notes for further clarification.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the value of $$$a_1$$$ in the end if both players play optimally.",
