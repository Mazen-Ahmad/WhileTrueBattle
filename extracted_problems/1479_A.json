  "statement": "This is an interactive problem . Homer likes arrays a lot and he wants to play a game with you. Homer has hidden from you a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ of integers $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You are asked to find any index $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$) which is a local minimum. For an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) is said to be a local minimum if $$$a_i < \\min\\{a_{i-1},a_{i+1}\\}$$$, where $$$a_0 = a_{n+1} = +\\infty$$$. An array is said to be a permutation of integers $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, if it contains all integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once. Initially, you are only given the value of $$$n$$$ without any other information about this permutation. At each interactive step, you are allowed to choose any $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) and make a query with it. As a response, you will be given the value of $$$a_i$$$. You are asked to find any index $$$k$$$ which is a local minimum after at most $$$100$$$ queries .",
