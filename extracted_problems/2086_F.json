  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. The jury has a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The following constraints apply to this string: the string has an odd length that does not exceed $$$99$$$; the string consists only of the characters \" a \" and \" b \". There is also a string $$$t$$$, which is initially empty. Then, $$$|s|$$$ steps happen. During the $$$i$$$-th step, the following events occur: first, the jury tells you the character $$$s_i$$$ and appends it to the end of the string $$$t$$$; then, you may swap any two characters in $$$t$$$, or do nothing. Your task is to ensure that after the $$$|s|$$$-th step, the string $$$t$$$ is a palindrome.",
