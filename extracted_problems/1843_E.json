  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ zeros. You are also given a set of $$$m$$$ not necessarily different segments. Each segment is defined by two numbers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$) and represents a subarray $$$a_{l_i}, a_{l_i+1}, \\dots, a_{r_i}$$$ of the array $$$a$$$. Let's call the segment $$$l_i, r_i$$$ beautiful if the number of ones on this segment is strictly greater than the number of zeros. For example, if $$$a = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]$$$, then the segment $$$[1, 5]$$$ is beautiful (the number of ones is $$$3$$$, the number of zeros is $$$2$$$), but the segment $$$[3, 4]$$$ is not is beautiful (the number of ones is $$$1$$$, the number of zeros is $$$1$$$). You also have $$$q$$$ changes. For each change you are given the number $$$1 \\le x \\le n$$$, which means that you must assign an element $$$a_x$$$ the value $$$1$$$. You have to find the first change after which at least one of $$$m$$$ given segments becomes beautiful , or report that none of them is beautiful after processing all $$$q$$$ changes.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of segments, respectively. Then there are $$$m$$$ lines consisting of two numbers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$) —the boundaries of the segments. The next line contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le n$$$) — the number of changes. The following $$$q$$$ lines each contain a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le n$$$) — the index of the array element that needs to be set to $$$1$$$. It is guaranteed that indexes in queries are distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the minimum change number after which at least one of the segments will be beautiful, or $$$-1$$$ if none of the segments will be beautiful.",
