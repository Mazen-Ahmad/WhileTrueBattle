  "statement": "There are $$$2n$$$ positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard. You start with a score of $$$0$$$. You will increase your score by performing the following move exactly $$$n$$$ times: Choose two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ that are written on the whiteboard. Add $$$\\min(x,y)$$$ to your score. Erase $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ from the whiteboard. Note that after performing the move $$$n$$$ times, there will be no more integers written on the whiteboard. Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the $$$n$$$ moves.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is $$$2n$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^7$$$) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.",
