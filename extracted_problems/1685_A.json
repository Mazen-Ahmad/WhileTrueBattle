  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Is it possible to arrange them on a circle so that each number is strictly greater than both its neighbors or strictly smaller than both its neighbors? In other words, check if there exists a rearrangement $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ of the integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ such that for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ at least one of the following conditions holds: $$$b_{i-1} < b_i > b_{i+1}$$$ $$$b_{i-1} > b_i < b_{i+1}$$$ To make sense of the previous formulas for $$$i=1$$$ and $$$i=n$$$, one shall define $$$b_0=b_n$$$ and $$$b_{n+1}=b_1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 3\\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of integers. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is not possible to arrange the numbers on the circle satisfying the conditions from the statement, output $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$. You can output each letter in any case. Otherwise, output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$. In the second line, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$, which are a rearrangement of $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ and satisfy the conditions from the statement. If there are multiple valid ways to arrange the numbers, you can output any of them.",
