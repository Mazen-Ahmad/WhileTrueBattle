  "statement": "You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Let's call some positive integer $$$a$$$ without leading zeroes palindromic if it remains the same after reversing the order of its digits. Find the number of distinct ways to express $$$n$$$ as a sum of positive palindromic integers. Two ways are considered different if the frequency of at least one palindromic integer is different in them. For example, $$$5=4+1$$$ and $$$5=3+1+1$$$ are considered different but $$$5=3+1+1$$$ and $$$5=1+3+1$$$ are considered the same. Formally, you need to find the number of distinct multisets of positive palindromic integers the sum of which is equal to $$$n$$$. Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 10^4$$$) denoting the number of testcases. Each testcase contains a single line of input containing a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 4\\cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the required sum of palindromic integers.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print a single integer denoting the required answer modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
