  "statement": "Let's call a triple of positive integers ($$$a, b, n$$$) strange if the equality $$$\\frac{an}{nb} = \\frac{a}{b}$$$ holds, where $$$an$$$ is the concatenation of $$$a$$$ and $$$n$$$ and $$$nb$$$ is the concatenation of $$$n$$$ and $$$b$$$. For the purpose of concatenation, the integers are considered without leading zeroes. For example, if $$$a = 1$$$, $$$b = 5$$$ and $$$n = 9$$$, then the triple is strange, because $$$\\frac{19}{95} = \\frac{1}{5}$$$. But $$$a = 7$$$, $$$b = 3$$$ and $$$n = 11$$$ is not strange, because $$$\\frac{711}{113} \\ne \\frac{7}{3}$$$. You are given three integers $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$ and $$$N$$$. Calculate the number of strange triples $$$(a, b, n$$$), such that $$$1 \\le a < A$$$, $$$1 \\le b < B$$$ and $$$1 \\le n < N$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The only line contains three integers $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$ and $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\le A, B \\le 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le N \\le 10^9$$$).",
