  "statement": "Masha and Olya have an important team olympiad coming up soon. In honor of this, Masha, for warm-up, suggested playing a game with Olya: There is an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Masha goes first, and the players take turns. Each move is described by the following sequence of actions: $$$\\bullet$$$ If the size of the array is $$$1$$$, the game ends. $$$\\bullet$$$ The player who is currently playing chooses two different indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le |a|$$$), and performs the following operation — removes $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ from the array and adds to the array a number equal to $$$\\lfloor \\frac{a_i + a_j}{2} \\rfloor \\cdot 2$$$. In other words, first divides the sum of the numbers $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_j$$$ by $$$2$$$ rounding down, and then multiplies the result by $$$2$$$. Masha aims to maximize the final number, while Olya aims to minimize it. Masha and Olya decided to play on each non-empty prefix of the initial array $$$a$$$, and asked for your help. For each $$$k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$, answer the following question. Let only the first $$$k$$$ elements of the array $$$a$$$ be present in the game, with indices $$$1, 2, \\ldots, k$$$ respectively. What number will remain at the end with optimal play by both players?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the size of the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2, \\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the array on which Masha and Olya play. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$k$$$-th of these numbers should be equal to the number that will remain at the end with optimal play by both players, on the array consisting of the first $$$k$$$ elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
