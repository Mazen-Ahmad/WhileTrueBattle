  "statement": "Harshith attained enlightenment in Competitive Programming by training under a Divine Tree. A divine tree is a rooted tree$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ with $$$n$$$ nodes, labelled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The divineness of a node $$$v$$$, denoted $$$d(v)$$$, is defined as the smallest node label on the unique simple path from the root to node $$$v$$$. Aryan, being a hungry Competitive Programmer, asked Harshith to pass on the knowledge. Harshith agreed on the condition that Aryan would be given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, and he had to construct a divine tree with $$$n$$$ nodes such that the total divineness of the tree is $$$m$$$, i.e., $$$\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n d(i)=m$$$. If no such tree exists, Aryan must report that it is impossible. Desperate for knowledge, Aryan turned to you for help in completing this task. As a good friend of his, help him solve the task. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree where one vertex is special and called the root.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 10^{12}$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer $$$k$$$ in one line — the root of the tree. Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follow, each containing a description of an edge of the tree — a pair of positive integers $$$u_i,v_i$$$ ($$$1\\le u_i,v_i\\le n$$$, $$$u_i\\ne v_i$$$), denoting the $$$i$$$-th edge connects vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. The edges and vertices of the edges can be printed in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there is no solution, print \"-1\" instead.",
