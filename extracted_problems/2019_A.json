  "statement": "EnV - Dynasty ⠀ You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of positive integers. You can color some elements of the array red, but there cannot be two adjacent red elements (i.e., for $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$$$, at least one of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$ must not be red). Your score is the maximum value of a red element plus the number of red elements. Find the maximum score you can get.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — the given array.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible score you can get after coloring some elements red according to the statement.",
