  "statement": "You are given four integers $$$n$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. You should build a sequence $$$a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ where $$$a_0 = 0$$$ and for each $$$i \\ge 1$$$ you can choose: either $$$a_i = a_{i - 1} + x$$$ or $$$a_i = a_{i - 1} - y$$$. Your goal is to build such a sequence $$$a$$$ that $$$a_i \\le B$$$ for all $$$i$$$ and $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{a_i}$$$ is maximum possible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Next $$$t$$$ cases follow. The first and only line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le B, x, y \\le 10^9$$$). It's guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n}{a_i}$$$.",
