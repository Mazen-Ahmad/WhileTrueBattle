  "statement": "MOOO! - Doja Cat ⠀ Farmer John has a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$, where every integer from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and challenges her to construct $$$p$$$ based on $$$a$$$. The array $$$a$$$ is constructed so that $$$a_i$$$ = $$$\\texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_i) - p_i$$$, where the $$$\\texttt{MEX}$$$ of an array is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in that array. For example, $$$\\texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0$$$ and $$$\\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2$$$. Help Bessie construct any valid permutation $$$p$$$ that satisfies $$$a$$$. The input is given in such a way that at least one valid $$$p$$$ exists. If there are multiple possible $$$p$$$, it is enough to print one of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the lengths of $$$p$$$ and $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-n \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid $$$p$$$ for the given data. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers on a new line, the elements of $$$p$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
