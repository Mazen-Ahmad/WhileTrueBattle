  "statement": "You are a given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Find a subarray $$$a[l..r]$$$ with length at least $$$k$$$ with the largest median. A median in an array of length $$$n$$$ is an element which occupies position number $$$\\lfloor \\frac{n + 1}{2} \\rfloor$$$ after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example: $$$median([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 2$$$, $$$median([3, 2, 1]) = 2$$$, $$$median([2, 1, 2, 1]) = 1$$$. Subarray $$$a[l..r]$$$ is a contiguous part of the array $$$a$$$, i. e. the array $$$a_l,a_{l+1},\\ldots,a_r$$$ for some $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$, its length is $$$r - l + 1$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Output one integer $$$m$$$ â€” the maximum median you can get.",
