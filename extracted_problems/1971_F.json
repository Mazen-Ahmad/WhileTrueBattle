  "statement": "Given an integer $$$r$$$, find the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean distance from $$$(0, 0)$$$ greater than or equal to $$$r$$$ but strictly less than $$$r+1$$$. A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates. The Euclidean distance from $$$(0, 0)$$$ to the point $$$(x,y)$$$ is $$$\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq r \\leq 10^5$$$). The sum of $$$r$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of lattice points that have an Euclidean distance $$$d$$$ from $$$(0, 0)$$$ such that $$$r \\leq d < r+1$$$.",
