  "statement": "You are given a prime number $$$n$$$, and an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,\\ldots, b_n$$$, where $$$0 \\leq b_i < n$$$ for each $$$1 \\le i \\leq n$$$. You have to find a matrix $$$a$$$ of size $$$n \\times n$$$ such that all of the following requirements hold: $$$0 \\le a_{i,j} < n$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$. $$$a_{r_1, c_1} + a_{r_2, c_2} \\not\\equiv a_{r_1, c_2} + a_{r_2, c_1} \\pmod n$$$ for all positive integers $$$r_1$$$, $$$r_2$$$, $$$c_1$$$, and $$$c_2$$$ such that $$$1 \\le r_1 < r_2 \\le n$$$ and $$$1 \\le c_1 < c_2 \\le n$$$. $$$a_{i,i} = b_i$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\leq n$$$. Here $$$x \\not \\equiv y \\pmod m$$$ denotes that $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ give different remainders when divided by $$$m$$$. If there are multiple solutions, output any. It can be shown that such a matrix always exists under the given constraints.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n < 350$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le b_i < n$$$) â€” the required values on the main diagonal of the matrix. It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is prime .",
  "outputFormat": "Print $$$n$$$ lines. On the $$$i$$$-th line, print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \\ldots, a_{i, n}$$$, each separated with a space. If there are multiple solutions, output any.",
