  "statement": "Madoka is a very strange girl, and therefore she suddenly wondered how many pairs of integers $$$(a, b)$$$ exist, where $$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, for which $$$\\frac{\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)} \\leq 3$$$. In this problem, $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor of the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and $$$\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)$$$ denotes the smallest common multiple of the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first and the only line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^8$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output a single integer — the number of pairs of integers satisfying the condition.",
