  "statement": "Ken Arai - COMPLEX ⠀ This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, the constraints on $$$n$$$ and the time limit are higher. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. A set of (closed) segments is complex if it can be partitioned into some subsets such that all the subsets have the same size; and a pair of segments intersects if and only if the two segments are in the same subset. You are given $$$n$$$ segments $$$[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\ldots, [l_n, r_n]$$$. Find the maximum size of a complex subset of these segments.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of segments. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le 2n$$$) — the left endpoints of the segments. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n$$$ ($$$l_i \\leq r_i \\le 2n$$$) — the right endpoints of the segments. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum size of a complex subset of the given segments.",
