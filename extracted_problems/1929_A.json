  "statement": "Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. He found out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the values $$$(a_i - a_{i - 1})$$$ for all integers $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$n$$$. Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array $$$a$$$ that he can obtain, if he can rearrange its elements in any way.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array $$$a$$$ that can be obtained.",
