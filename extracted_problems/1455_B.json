  "statement": "You are standing on the $$$\\mathit{OX}$$$-axis at point $$$0$$$ and you want to move to an integer point $$$x > 0$$$. You can make several jumps. Suppose you're currently at point $$$y$$$ ($$$y$$$ may be negative) and jump for the $$$k$$$-th time. You can: either jump to the point $$$y + k$$$ or jump to the point $$$y - 1$$$. What is the minimum number of jumps you need to reach the point $$$x$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le 10^6$$$) — the destination point.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum number of jumps to reach $$$x$$$. It can be proved that we can reach any integer point $$$x$$$.",
