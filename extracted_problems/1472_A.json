  "statement": "For the New Year, Polycarp decided to send postcards to all his $$$n$$$ friends. He wants to make postcards with his own hands. For this purpose, he has a sheet of paper of size $$$w \\times h$$$, which can be cut into pieces. Polycarp can cut any sheet of paper $$$w \\times h$$$ that he has in only two cases: If $$$w$$$ is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size $$$\\frac{w}{2} \\times h$$$; If $$$h$$$ is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size $$$w \\times \\frac{h}{2}$$$; If $$$w$$$ and $$$h$$$ are even at the same time, then Polycarp can cut the sheet according to any of the rules above. After cutting a sheet of paper, the total number of sheets of paper is increased by $$$1$$$. Help Polycarp to find out if he can cut his sheet of size $$$w \\times h$$$ at into $$$n$$$ or more pieces, using only the rules described above.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$, $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le w, h \\le 10^4, 1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$) — the width and height of the sheet Polycarp has and the number of friends he needs to send a postcard to.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output on a separate line: \" YES \", if it is possible to cut a sheet of size $$$w \\times h$$$ into at least $$$n$$$ pieces; \" NO \" otherwise. You can output \" YES \" and \" NO \" in any case (for example, the strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).",
