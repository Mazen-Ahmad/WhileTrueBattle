  "statement": "Given an undirected connected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. The graph contains no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and multiple edges (i.e. no more than one edge between each pair of vertices). The vertices of the graph are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Find the number of paths from a vertex $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ whose length differs from the shortest path from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ by no more than $$$1$$$. It is necessary to consider all suitable paths, even if they pass through the same vertex or edge more than once (i.e. they are not simple). Graph consisting of $$$6$$$ of vertices and $$$8$$$ of edges For example, let $$$n = 6$$$, $$$m = 8$$$, $$$s = 6$$$ and $$$t = 1$$$, and let the graph look like the figure above. Then the length of the shortest path from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ is $$$1$$$. Consider all paths whose length is at most $$$1 + 1 = 2$$$. $$$6 \\rightarrow 1$$$. The length of the path is $$$1$$$. $$$6 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 1$$$. Path length is $$$2$$$. $$$6 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1$$$. Path length is $$$2$$$. $$$6 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$$$. Path length is $$$2$$$. There is a total of $$$4$$$ of matching paths.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of test contains the number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) —the number of test cases in the test. Before each test case, there is a blank line. The first line of test case contains two numbers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) —the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The second line contains two numbers $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le s, t \\le n$$$, $$$s \\neq t$$$) —the numbers of the start and end vertices of the path. The following $$$m$$$ lines contain descriptions of edges: the $$$i$$$th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le u_i,v_i \\le n$$$) — the numbers of vertices that connect the $$$i$$$th edge. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and does not contain loops and multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ on all test cases of input data does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$m$$$ on all test cases of input data does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single number — the number of paths from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ such that their length differs from the length of the shortest path by no more than $$$1$$$. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
