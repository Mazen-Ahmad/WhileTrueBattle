  "statement": "You have an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Your task is to answer $$$q$$$ queries: given $$$x,y$$$, find the number of pairs $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$) that both $$$a_i + a_j = x$$$ and $$$a_i \\cdot a_j = y$$$. That is, for the array $$$[1,3,2]$$$ and asking for $$$x=3,y=2$$$ the answer is $$$1$$$: $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=2$$$ fail because $$$1 + 3 = 4$$$ and not $$$3,$$$ also $$$1 \\cdot 3=3$$$ and not $$$2$$$; $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=3$$$ satisfies both conditions; $$$i=2$$$ and $$$j=3$$$ fail because $$$3 + 2 = 5$$$ and not $$$3,$$$ also $$$3 \\cdot 2=6$$$ and not $$$2$$$;",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The second line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le |a_i| \\le 10^9$$$) — array $$$a$$$. The fourth line of each test case contains the integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of requests. The next $$$q$$$ lines contain two numbers each $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le |x|\\le 2\\cdot 10^9,1\\le |y|\\le 10^{18}$$$) — request. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$. This is also guaranteed for the sum of $$$q$$$ values.",
