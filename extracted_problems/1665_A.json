  "statement": "You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. You have to find $$$4$$$ positive integers $$$a, b, c, d$$$ such that $$$a + b + c + d = n$$$, and $$$\\gcd(a, b) = \\operatorname{lcm}(c, d)$$$. If there are several possible answers you can output any of them. It is possible to show that the answer always exists. In this problem $$$\\gcd(a, b)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and $$$\\operatorname{lcm}(c, d)$$$ denotes the least common multiple of $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. Each test case contains a single line with integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$) — the sum of $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, and $$$d$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output $$$4$$$ positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ such that $$$a + b + c + d = n$$$ and $$$\\gcd(a, b) = \\operatorname{lcm}(c, d)$$$.",
