  "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ integers, each integer is from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, all of them are pairwise distinct. You have to paint them red and blue (each integer should have exactly one color). The cost of painting is the number of pairs $$$(x, y)$$$ such that $$$y \\bmod x = 0$$$, $$$y$$$ is red and $$$x$$$ is blue. For each $$$k \\in [1, n]$$$, calculate the maximum cost of painting if exactly $$$k$$$ integers should have a red color.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each $$$k \\in [1,n]$$$ print one integer â€” the maximum cost of painting, if exactly $$$k$$$ integers should be red.",
