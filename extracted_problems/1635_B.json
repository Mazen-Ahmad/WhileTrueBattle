  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Each element in this array is an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$. You can perform several operations to this array. During an operation, you can replace an element in the array with any integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$. Output the minimum number of operations needed such that the resulting array doesn't contain any local maximums, and the resulting array after the operations. An element $$$a_i$$$ is a local maximum if it is strictly larger than both of its neighbors (that is, $$$a_i > a_{i - 1}$$$ and $$$a_i > a_{i + 1}$$$). Since $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_n$$$ have only one neighbor each, they will never be a local maximum.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line will contain a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 10000)$$$ — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5)$$$ — the size of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots ,a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9)$$$, the elements of array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, first output a line containing a single integer $$$m$$$ — minimum number of operations required. Then ouput a line consist of $$$n$$$ integers — the resulting array after the operations. Note that this array should differ in exactly $$$m$$$ elements from the initial array. If there are multiple answers, print any.",
