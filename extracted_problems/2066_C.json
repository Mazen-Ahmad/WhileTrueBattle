  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Also, you are given three variables $$$P,Q,R$$$, initially equal to zero. You need to process all the numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, in the order from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ . When processing the next $$$a_i$$$, you must perform exactly one of the three actions of your choice: $$$P := P \\oplus a_i$$$ $$$Q := Q \\oplus a_i$$$ $$$R := R \\oplus a_i$$$ $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation . When performing actions, you must follow the main rule : it is necessary that after each action, all three numbers $$$P,Q,R$$$ are not pairwise distinct. There are a total of $$$3^n$$$ ways to perform all $$$n$$$ actions. How many of them do not violate the main rule ? Since the answer can be quite large, find it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the number of ways to perform all $$$n$$$ actions without violating the main rule , modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
