  "statement": "This is an interactive problem. There are $$$n$$$ words in a text editor. The $$$i$$$-th word has length $$$l_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq 2000$$$). The array $$$l$$$ is hidden and only known by the grader. The text editor displays words in lines, splitting each two words in a line with at least one space. Note that a line does not have to end with a space. Let the height of the text editor refer to the number of lines used. For the given width , the text editor will display words in such a way that the height is minimized. More formally, suppose that the text editor has width $$$w$$$. Let $$$a$$$ be an array of length $$$k+1$$$ where $$$1=a_1 < a_2 < \\ldots < a_{k+1}=n+1$$$. $$$a$$$ is a valid array if for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq k$$$, $$$l_{a_i}+1+l_{a_i+1}+1+\\ldots+1+l_{a_{i+1}-1} \\leq w$$$. Then the height of the text editor is the minimum $$$k$$$ over all valid arrays. Note that if $$$w < \\max(l_i)$$$, the text editor cannot display all the words properly and will crash, and the height of the text editor will be $$$0$$$ instead. You can ask $$$n+30$$$ queries. In one query, you provide a width $$$w$$$. Then, the grader will return the height $$$h_w$$$ of the text editor when its width is $$$w$$$. Find the minimum area of the text editor, which is the minimum value of $$$w \\cdot h_w$$$ over all $$$w$$$ for which $$$h_w \\neq 0$$$. The lengths are fixed in advance. In other words, the interactor is not adaptive .",
  "inputFormat": "The first and only line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2000$$$) â€” the number of words on the text editor. It is guaranteed that the hidden lengths $$$l_i$$$ satisfy $$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq 2000$$$.",
