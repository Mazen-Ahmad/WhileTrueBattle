  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ participants in a competition, participant $$$i$$$ having a strength of $$$s_i$$$. Every participant wonders how much of an advantage they have over the other best participant. In other words, each participant $$$i$$$ wants to know the difference between $$$s_i$$$ and $$$s_j$$$, where $$$j$$$ is the strongest participant in the competition, not counting $$$i$$$ (a difference can be negative). So, they ask you for your help! For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) output the difference between $$$s_i$$$ and the maximum strength of any participant other than participant $$$i$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The following line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated positive integers $$$s_1$$$, $$$s_2$$$, ..., $$$s_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the strengths of the participants. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
