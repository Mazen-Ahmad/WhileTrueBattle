  "statement": "You are given five integers $$$n$$$, $$$dx_1$$$, $$$dy_1$$$, $$$dx_2$$$ and $$$dy_2$$$. You have to select $$$n$$$ distinct pairs of integers $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ in such a way that, for every possible pair of integers $$$(x, y)$$$, there exists exactly one triple of integers $$$(a, b, i)$$$ meeting the following constraints: $$$ \\begin{cases} x \\, = \\, x_i + a \\cdot dx_1 + b \\cdot dx_2, \\\\ y \\, = \\, y_i + a \\cdot dy_1 + b \\cdot dy_2. \\end{cases} $$$",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line contains two integers $$$dx_1$$$ and $$$dy_1$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\le dx_1, dy_1 \\le 10^6$$$). The third line contains two integers $$$dx_2$$$ and $$$dy_2$$$ ($$$-10^6 \\le dx_2, dy_2 \\le 10^6$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "If it is impossible to correctly select $$$n$$$ pairs of integers, print NO . Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and then $$$n$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^9$$$). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
