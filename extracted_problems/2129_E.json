  "statement": "You are given an unweighted, undirected graph $$$G$$$ with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$ edges. The graph $$$G$$$ contains no self-loops or multiple edges. We denote the node set of $$$G$$$ as $$$V$$$. For any node subset $$$V' \\subseteq V$$$, the corresponding induced subgraph, denoted by $$$G[V']$$$, is defined as follows: $$$G[V']$$$ is the graph whose node set is $$$V'$$$, and whose edge set consists of all edges in $$$G$$$ with both endpoints in $$$V'$$$. Your task is to answer $$$q$$$ queries. Each query provides three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$k$$$. Denoting $$$V'=\\{l,l+1,\\ldots,r\\}$$$, you need to find the $$$k$$$-th smallest value among $$$f(l,G[V'])$$$, $$$f(l+1,G[V'])$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$ , $$$f(r,G[V'])$$$ (i.e., the $$$k$$$-th value in increasing order; repeated values are counted multiple times). Here, $$$f(u,G[V'])=\\bigoplus_{(u,v)\\in G[V']}v$$$. In other words, it is the bitwise XOR value of the labels of all adjacent nodes of node $$$u$$$ in graph $$$G[V']$$$. You might want to read the notes for a better understanding.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1.5 \\cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. Each test case begins with two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 1.5 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 1.5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes and edges, respectively. The next $$$m$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n$$$, $$$u_i \\neq v_i$$$), representing an undirected edge between nodes $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 1.5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le r-l+1$$$), defining a query about the induced subgraph $$$G[\\{l,\\ldots,r\\}]$$$. It is guaranteed that the graph contains no self-loops or multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$,$$$m$$$, and $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1.5 \\cdot 10^5$$$, respectively.",
