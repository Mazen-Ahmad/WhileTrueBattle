  "statement": "Berland Music is a music streaming service built specifically to support Berland local artist. Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module. So imagine Monocarp got recommended $$$n$$$ songs, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th song had its predicted rating equal to $$$p_i$$$, where $$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$ and every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. In other words, $$$p$$$ is a permutation. After listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string $$$s$$$, such that $$$s_i=0$$$ means that he disliked the $$$i$$$-th song, and $$$s_i=1$$$ means that he liked it. Now the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that: the new ratings $$$q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n$$$ still form a permutation ($$$1 \\le q_i \\le n$$$; each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once); every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all $$$i, j$$$ such that $$$s_i=1$$$ and $$$s_j=0$$$, $$$q_i>q_j$$$ should hold). Among all valid permutations $$$q$$$ find the one that has the smallest value of $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|$$$, where $$$|x|$$$ is an absolute value of $$$x$$$. Print the permutation $$$q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n$$$. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of songs. The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) — the permutation of the predicted ratings. The third line contains a single string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ characters. Each character is either a $$$0$$$ or a $$$1$$$. $$$0$$$ means that Monocarp disliked the song, and $$$1$$$ means that he liked it. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print a permutation $$$q$$$ — the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|$$$ is minimum possible, you can print any of them.",
