  "statement": "Mihai has just learned about the MEX concept and since he liked it so much, he decided to use it right away. Given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers, Mihai wants to create a new array $$$b$$$ that is formed in the following way: While $$$a$$$ is not empty: Choose an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq |a|$$$). Append the MEX of the first $$$k$$$ numbers of the array $$$a$$$ to the end of array $$$b$$$ and erase them from the array $$$a$$$, shifting the positions of the remaining numbers in $$$a$$$. But, since Mihai loves big arrays as much as the MEX concept, he wants the new array $$$b$$$ to be the lexicographically maximum . So, Mihai asks you to tell him what the maximum array $$$b$$$ that can be created by constructing the array optimally is. An array $$$x$$$ is lexicographically greater than an array $$$y$$$ if in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ $$$x_i > y_i$$$ or if $$$|x| > |y|$$$ and $$$y$$$ is a prefix of $$$x$$$ (where $$$|x|$$$ denotes the size of the array $$$x$$$). The MEX of a set of non-negative integers is the minimal non-negative integer such that it is not in the set. For example, MEX ({$$${1, 2, 3}$$$}) $$$= 0$$$ and MEX ({$$${0, 1, 2, 4, 5}$$$}) $$$= 3$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th integer from the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print $$$m$$$ — the length of the maximum array $$$b$$$ Mihai can create, followed by $$$m$$$ integers denoting the elements of the array $$$b$$$.",
