  "statement": "You are given a positive (greater than zero) integer $$$n$$$. You have to represent $$$n$$$ as the sum of integers (possibly negative) consisting only of ones (digits ' 1 '). For example, $$$24 = 11 + 11 + 1 + 1$$$ and $$$102 = 111 - 11 + 1 + 1$$$. Among all possible representations, you have to find the one that uses the minimum number of ones in total.",
  "inputFormat": "The single line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n < 10^{50}$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer $$$x$$$ â€” the minimum number of ones, such that there exist a representation of $$$n$$$ as the sum of integers (possibly negative) that uses $$$x$$$ ones in total.",
