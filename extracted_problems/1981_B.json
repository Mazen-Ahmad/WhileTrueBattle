  "statement": "There is a sequence $$$a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots$$$ of infinite length. Initially $$$a_i = i$$$ for every non-negative integer $$$i$$$. After every second, each element of the sequence will simultaneously change. $$$a_i$$$ will change to $$$a_{i - 1} \\mid a_i \\mid a_{i + 1}$$$ for every positive integer $$$i$$$. $$$a_0$$$ will change to $$$a_0 \\mid a_1$$$. Here, $$$|$$$ denotes bitwise OR . Turtle is asked to find the value of $$$a_n$$$ after $$$m$$$ seconds. In particular, if $$$m = 0$$$, then he needs to find the initial value of $$$a_n$$$. He is tired of calculating so many values, so please help him!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$0 \\le n, m \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer â€” the value of $$$a_n$$$ after $$$m$$$ seconds.",
