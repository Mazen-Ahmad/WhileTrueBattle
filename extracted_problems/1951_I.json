  "statement": "wowaka ft. Hatsune Miku - Ura-Omote Lovers ඞ You are given an undirected connected simple graph with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$ edges, where edge $$$i$$$ connects node $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$, with two positive parameters $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ attached to it. Additionally, you are also given an integer $$$k$$$. A non-negative array $$$x$$$ with size $$$m$$$ is called a $$$k$$$-spanning-tree generator if it satisfies the following: Consider the undirected multigraph with $$$n$$$ nodes where edge $$$i$$$ is cloned $$$x_i$$$ times (i.e. there are $$$x_i$$$ edges connecting $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$). It is possible to partition the edges of this graph into $$$k$$$ spanning trees, where each edge belongs to exactly one spanning tree$$$^\\dagger$$$. The cost of such array $$$x$$$ is defined as $$$\\sum_{i = 1}^m a_i x_i^2 + b_i x_i$$$. Find the minimum cost of a $$$k$$$-spanning-tree generator. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A spanning tree of a (multi)graph is a subset of the graph's edges that form a tree connecting all vertices of the graph.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50, n - 1 \\le m \\le \\min(50, \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}), 1 \\le k \\le 10^7$$$) — the number of nodes in the graph, the number of edges in the graph, and the parameter for the $$$k$$$-spanning-tree generator. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines of each test case contains four integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$, $$$a_i$$$, and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n, u_i \\neq v_i, 1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le 1000$$$) — the endpoints of the edge $$$i$$$ and its two parameters. It is guaranteed that the graph is simple and connected. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ and the sum of $$$m^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2500$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer: the minimum cost of a $$$k$$$-spanning-tree generator.",
