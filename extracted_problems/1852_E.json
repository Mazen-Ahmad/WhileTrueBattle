  "statement": "Ntarsis has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The power of a subarray $$$a_l \\dots a_r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$) is defined as: The largest value $$$x$$$ such that $$$a_l \\dots a_r$$$ contains $$$x$$$ and neither $$$a_1 \\dots a_{l-1}$$$ nor $$$a_{r+1} \\dots a_n$$$ contains $$$x$$$. If no such $$$x$$$ exists, the power is $$$0$$$. Call an array $$$b$$$ a rival to $$$a$$$ if the following holds: The length of both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are equal to some $$$n$$$. Over all $$$l, r$$$ where $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$, the power of $$$a_l \\dots a_r$$$ equals the power of $$$b_l \\dots b_r$$$. The elements of $$$b$$$ are positive. Ntarsis wants you to find a rival $$$b$$$ to $$$a$$$ such that the sum of $$$b_i$$$ over $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ is maximized. Help him with this task!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case has a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$). The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ â€” a valid rival to $$$a$$$ such that $$$b_1 + b_2 + \\cdots + b_n$$$ is maximal. If there exist multiple rivals with the maximum sum, output any of them.",
