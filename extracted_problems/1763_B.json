  "statement": "To destroy humanity, The Monster Association sent $$$n$$$ monsters to Earth's surface. The $$$i$$$-th monster has health $$$h_i$$$ and power $$$p_i$$$. With his last resort attack, True Spiral Incineration Cannon, Genos can deal $$$k$$$ damage to all monsters alive. In other words, Genos can reduce the health of all monsters by $$$k$$$ (if $$$k > 0$$$) with a single attack. However, after every attack Genos makes, the monsters advance. With their combined efforts, they reduce Genos' attack damage by the power of the $$$^\\dagger$$$weakest monster $$$^\\ddagger$$$alive. In other words, the minimum $$$p_i$$$ among all currently living monsters is subtracted from the value of $$$k$$$ after each attack. $$$^\\dagger$$$The Weakest monster is the one with the least power. $$$^\\ddagger$$$A monster is alive if its health is strictly greater than $$$0$$$. Will Genos be successful in killing all the monsters?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of monsters and Genos' initial attack damage. Then two lines follow, each containing $$$n$$$ integers describing the arrays $$$h$$$ and $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\le h_i, p_i \\le 10^9$$$). It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer — \" YES \" (without quotes) if Genos could kill all monsters and \" NO \" otherwise.",
