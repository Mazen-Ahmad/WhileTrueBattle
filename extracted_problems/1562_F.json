  "statement": "Do you know what tubular bells are? They are a musical instrument made up of cylindrical metal tubes. In an orchestra, tubular bells are used to mimic the ringing of bells. Mike has tubular bells, too! They consist of $$$n$$$ tubes, and each of the tubes has a length that can be expressed by a integer from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive. It is clear that the lengths of all the tubes are different (it makes no sense to make the same tubes). It is also known that $$$r-l+1 = n$$$. Formally, we can say that Mike's tubular bells are described by a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that contains all numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive, with $$$a_i$$$ denoting the length of the $$$i$$$-th tube. You are offered an interesting task: to guess what Mike's instrument looks like. Simply, you must guess the permutation. Mike won't tell you $$$l$$$ or $$$r$$$. He will only tell you $$$n$$$, and will allow you to ask no more than $$$n + 5000$$$ queries. In each query, you name two positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ such that $$$1 \\le x, y \\le n, x \\neq y$$$. In response to this query, the program written by Mike will give you $$$\\mathrm{lcm}(a_x, a_y)$$$, where $$$\\mathrm{lcm}(c,d)$$$ denotes the least common multiple of $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$. Solve Mike's problem!",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains one positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 20$$$), denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The single line of each test case contains one positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) â€” number of tubes in Mike's tubular bells. Also $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, i.e. the lengths of the tubes do not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of maximal number of queries (i.e. $$$n + 5000$$$) over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5 + 5000$$$. It means that sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5 + 5000 - t \\cdot 5000$$$.",
