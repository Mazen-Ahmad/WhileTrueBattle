  "statement": "Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together. In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets $$$2$$$ points while the loser gets $$$0$$$, and in case of a draw, both players get $$$1$$$ point each. Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at all. You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$ and $$$p_3$$$. Additionally, it is guaranteed that $$$p_1 \\leq p_2 \\leq p_3$$$ holds. Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If there isn't any way to obtain $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$ and $$$p_3$$$ as a result of a non-negative number of games between the three players, print $$$-1$$$ instead.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$ and $$$p_3$$$ ($$$0 \\leq p_1 \\leq p_2 \\leq p_3 \\leq 30$$$) — the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws that could've happened, or $$$-1$$$ if the scores aren't consistent with any valid set of games and results.",
