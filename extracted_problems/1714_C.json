  "statement": "Find the minimum number with the given sum of digits $$$s$$$ such that all digits in it are distinct (i.e. all digits are unique). For example, if $$$s=20$$$, then the answer is $$$389$$$. This is the minimum number in which all digits are different and the sum of the digits is $$$20$$$ ($$$3+8+9=20$$$). For the given $$$s$$$ print the required number.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 45$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case is specified by a line that contains the only integer $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le s \\le 45$$$).",
