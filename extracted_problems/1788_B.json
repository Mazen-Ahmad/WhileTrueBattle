  "statement": "The sum of digits of a non-negative integer $$$a$$$ is the result of summing up its digits together when written in the decimal system. For example, the sum of digits of $$$123$$$ is $$$6$$$ and the sum of digits of $$$10$$$ is $$$1$$$. In a formal way, the sum of digits of $$$\\displaystyle a=\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} a_i \\cdot 10^i$$$, where $$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 9$$$, is defined as $$$\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}{a_i}$$$. Given an integer $$$n$$$, find two non-negative integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ which satisfy the following conditions. $$$x+y=n$$$, and the sum of digits of $$$x$$$ and the sum of digits of $$$y$$$ differ by at most $$$1$$$. It can be shown that such $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ always exist.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$). Each test case consists of a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$$$)",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any.",
