  "statement": "Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty $$$x$$$ and decided to make it the second problem for Codeforces Round #921. But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a problemset of $$$n$$$ sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to $$$x$$$. The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset. Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties of the sub-problems optimally.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\leq t\\leq 10^3$$$) denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers $$$x$$$ ($$$1\\leq x\\leq 10^8$$$) and $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq x$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.",
