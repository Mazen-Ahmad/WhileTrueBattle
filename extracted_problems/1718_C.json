  "statement": "Tonya was given an array of $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ written on a postcard for his birthday. For some reason, the postcard turned out to be a cyclic array , so the index of the element located strictly to the right of the $$$n$$$-th is $$$1$$$. Tonya wanted to study it better, so he bought a robot \"Burenka-179\". A program for Burenka is a pair of numbers $$$(s, k)$$$, where $$$1 \\leq s \\leq n$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq n-1$$$. Note that $$$k$$$ cannot be equal to $$$n$$$. Initially, Tonya puts the robot in the position of the array $$$s$$$. After that, Burenka makes exactly $$$n$$$ steps through the array. If at the beginning of a step Burenka stands in the position $$$i$$$, then the following happens: The number $$$a_{i}$$$ is added to the usefulness of the program. \"Burenka\" moves $$$k$$$ positions to the right ($$$i := i + k$$$ is executed, if $$$i$$$ becomes greater than $$$n$$$, then $$$i := i - n$$$). Help Tonya find the maximum possible usefulness of a program for \"Burenka\" if the initial usefulness of any program is $$$0$$$. Also, Tony's friend Ilyusha asks him to change the array $$$q$$$ times. Each time he wants to assign $$$a_p := x$$$ for a given index $$$p$$$ and a value $$$x$$$. You need to find the maximum possible usefulness of the program after each of these changes.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) is the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array. The following $$$q$$$ lines contain changes, each of them contains two integers $$$p$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p \\leq n$$$, $$$1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$$$), meaning you should assign $$$a_p := x$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$q+1$$$ numbers — the maximum usefulness of a program initially and after each of the changes.",
