  "statement": "You are given a permutation$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. We call an index $$$i$$$ good if $$$a_i=i$$$ is satisfied. After each second, we rotate all indices that are not good to the right by one position. Formally, Let $$$s_1,s_2,\\ldots,s_k$$$ be the indices of $$$a$$$ that are not good in increasing order. That is, $$$s_j < s_{j+1}$$$ and if index $$$i$$$ is not good, then there exists $$$j$$$ such that $$$s_j=i$$$. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, we assign $$$a_{s_{(i \\% k+1)}} := a_{s_i}$$$ all at once. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, find the first time that index $$$i$$$ becomes good. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$) — the size of permutation $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of permutation $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single line containing $$$n$$$ integers where the $$$i$$$-th integer represents the first time that index $$$i$$$ becomes good.",
