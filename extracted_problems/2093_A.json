  "statement": "We call an array $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$k$$$ positive integers, palindromic if $$$[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k] = [a_k, a_{k-1}, \\dots, a_1]$$$. For example, the arrays $$$[1, 2, 1]$$$ and $$$[5, 1, 1, 5]$$$ are palindromic, while the arrays $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ and $$$[21, 12]$$$ are not. We call a number $$$k$$$ an ideal generator if any integer $$$n$$$ ($$$n \\ge k$$$) can be represented as the sum of the elements of a palindromic array of length exactly $$$k$$$. Each element of the array must be greater than $$$0$$$. For example, the number $$$1$$$ is an ideal generator because any natural number $$$n$$$ can be generated using the array $$$[n]$$$. However, the number $$$2$$$ is not an ideal generator — there is no palindromic array of length $$$2$$$ that sums to $$$3$$$. Determine whether the given number $$$k$$$ is an ideal generator.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le 1000$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each number $$$k$$$, you need to output the word \"YES\" if it is an ideal generator, or \"NO\" otherwise. You may output \"Yes\" and \"No\" in any case (for example, the strings \"yES\" , \"yes\" , and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
