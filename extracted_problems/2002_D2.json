  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, you are given a generic tree and the constraints on $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ are higher. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. You are given a rooted tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and the root is the vertex $$$1$$$. You are also given a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ of $$$[1,2,\\ldots,n]$$$. You need to answer $$$q$$$ queries. For each query, you are given two integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$; you need to swap $$$p_x$$$ and $$$p_y$$$ and determine if $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ is a valid DFS order$$$^\\dagger$$$ of the given tree. Please note that the swaps are persistent through queries. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A DFS order is found by calling the following $$$\\texttt{dfs}$$$ function on the given tree. dfs_order = [] function dfs(v): append v to the back of dfs_order pick an arbitrary permutation s of children of v for child in s: dfs(child) dfs(1) Note that the DFS order is not unique.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 3\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2\\le q\\le 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries. The next line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$a_2,a_3,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i<i$$$) — the parent of each vertex in the given tree. The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\\le p_i\\le n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) — the initial permutation $$$p$$$. The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ ($$$1\\le x,y\\le n,x\\neq y$$$) — the positions of the elements to swap in the permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$3\\cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of all $$$q$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print $$$q$$$ lines corresponding to the $$$q$$$ queries. For each query, output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if there is a DFS order that exactly equals the current permutation, and output $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise. You can output $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{No}$$$ in any case (for example, strings $$$\\texttt{yEs}$$$, $$$\\texttt{yes}$$$, $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ will be recognized as a positive response).",
