  "statement": "Counting is Fun! — satyam343 Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$, find the number of triplets ($$$a,b,c$$$) of positive integers such that $$$ab + ac + bc \\le n$$$ and $$$a + b + c \\le x$$$. Note that order matters (e.g. ($$$1, 1, 2$$$) and ($$$1, 2, 1$$$) are treated as different) and $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ must be strictly greater than $$$0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,x \\leq 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$ and that the sum of $$$x$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
