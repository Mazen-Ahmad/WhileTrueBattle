  "statement": "There is a $$$n \\times m$$$ grid. You are standing at cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ and your goal is to finish at cell $$$(n, m)$$$. You can move to the neighboring cells to the right or down. In other words, suppose you are standing at cell $$$(x, y)$$$. You can: move right to the cell $$$(x, y + 1)$$$ — it costs $$$x$$$ burles; move down to the cell $$$(x + 1, y)$$$ — it costs $$$y$$$ burles. Can you reach cell $$$(n, m)$$$ spending exactly $$$k$$$ burles?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 100$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le 10^4$$$) — the sizes of grid and the exact amount of money you need to spend.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if you can reach cell $$$(n, m)$$$ spending exactly $$$k$$$ burles, print YES . Otherwise, print NO . You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs , yes , Yes and YES are all recognized as positive answer).",
