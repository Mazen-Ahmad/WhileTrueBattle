  "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$. Find any permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ such that: For all $$$2 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$\\max(p_{i - 1}, p_i) \\bmod i$$$ $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ $$$= i - 1$$$ is satisfied. If it is impossible to find such a permutation $$$p$$$, output $$$-1$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$$$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 99$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case: If such a permutation $$$p$$$ doesn't exist, output a single integer $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ — the permutation $$$p$$$ you've found. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.",
