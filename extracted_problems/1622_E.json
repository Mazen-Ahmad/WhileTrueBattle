  "statement": "Petya is a math teacher. $$$n$$$ of his students has written a test consisting of $$$m$$$ questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not. If the student answers the $$$j$$$-th question correctly, he gets $$$p_j$$$ points (otherwise, he gets $$$0$$$ points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array $$$p$$$ is a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. For the $$$i$$$-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get $$$x_i$$$ points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - r_i|$$$, where $$$r_i$$$ is the number of points that the $$$i$$$-th student has got for the test. Your task is to help Petya find such a permutation $$$p$$$ for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of students and the number of questions, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le x_i \\le \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ is the number of points that the $$$i$$$-th student expects to get. This is followed by $$$n$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th line contains the string $$$s_i$$$ ($$$|s_i| = m; s_{i, j} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$$$), where $$$s_{i, j}$$$ is $$$1$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th student has answered the $$$j$$$-th question correctly, and $$$0$$$ otherwise. The sum of $$$m$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.",
