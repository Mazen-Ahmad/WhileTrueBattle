  "statement": "There is a grid, consisting of $$$2$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$ from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. The robot starts in a cell $$$(1, 1)$$$. In one second, it can perform either of two actions: move into a cell adjacent by a side: up, right, down or left; remain in the same cell. The robot is not allowed to move outside the grid. Initially, all cells, except for the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$, are locked. Each cell $$$(i, j)$$$ contains a value $$$a_{i,j}$$$ — the moment that this cell gets unlocked. The robot can only move into a cell $$$(i, j)$$$ if at least $$$a_{i,j}$$$ seconds have passed before the move. The robot should visit all cells without entering any cell twice or more (cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ is considered entered at the start). It can finish in any cell. What is the fastest the robot can achieve that?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of columns of the grid. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$2$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\dots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_{i,j} \\le 10^9$$$) — the moment of time each cell gets unlocked. $$$a_{1,1} = 0$$$. If $$$a_{i,j} = 0$$$, then cell $$$(i, j)$$$ is unlocked from the start. The sum of $$$m$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print a single integer — the minimum amount of seconds that the robot can take to visit all cells without entering any cell twice or more.",
