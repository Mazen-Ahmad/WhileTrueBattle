  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, where all elements $$$a_i$$$ lie in the range $$$[1, k]$$$. How many different arrays $$$b$$$ of $$$m$$$ integers, where all elements $$$b_i$$$ lie in the range $$$[1, k]$$$, contain $$$a$$$ as a subsequence? Two arrays are considered different if they differ in at least one position. A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. Since the answer may be large, print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n \\le m \\le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$) — the size of $$$a$$$, the size of $$$b$$$, and the maximum value allowed in the arrays, respectively. The next line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i \\le k$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of suitable arrays $$$b$$$, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
