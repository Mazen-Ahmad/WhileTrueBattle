  "statement": "Let's call an ordered pair of nodes $$$(u, v)$$$ in a directed graph unidirectional if $$$u \\neq v$$$, there exists a path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$, and there are no paths from $$$v$$$ to $$$u$$$. A directed graph is called $$$p$$$-reachable if it contains exactly $$$p$$$ ordered pairs of nodes $$$(u, v)$$$ such that $$$u < v$$$ and $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ are reachable from each other. Find the minimum number of nodes required to create a $$$p$$$-reachable directed graph. Also, among all such $$$p$$$-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes, let $$$G$$$ denote a graph which maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs of nodes. Find this number.",
  "inputFormat": "The first and only line contains a single integer $$$p$$$ ($$$0 \\le p \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of ordered pairs of nodes.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single line containing two integers — the minimum number of nodes required to create a $$$p$$$-reachable directed graph, and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes among all such $$$p$$$-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes.",
