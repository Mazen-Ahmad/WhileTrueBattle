  "statement": "Three r there are's in strawberry. You are given an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose two distinct indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ where $$$\\bf{1\\le i < j\\le m}$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ is even, divide $$$b_i$$$ by $$$2$$$ and multiply $$$b_j$$$ by $$$2$$$. Your task is to maximize the sum of the array after performing any number of such operations. Since it could be large, output this sum modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. Since this problem is too easy, you are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and need to solve the problem for each prefix of $$$a$$$. In other words, denoting the maximum sum of $$$b$$$ after performing any number of such operations as $$$f(b)$$$, you need to output $$$f([a_1])$$$, $$$f([a_1,a_2])$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$f([a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n])$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$ respectively.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the starting values of array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers representing the answer for each prefix of $$$a$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
