  "statement": "Sam started playing with round buckets in the sandbox, while also scattering pebbles. His mom decided to buy him a new bucket, so she needs to solve the following task. You are given $$$n$$$ distinct points with integer coordinates $$$A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$$$. All points were generated from the square $$$[-10^8, 10^8] \\times [-10^8, 10^8]$$$ uniformly and independently. You are given positive integers $$$k$$$, $$$l$$$, such that $$$k \\leq l \\leq n$$$. You want to select a subsegment $$$A_i, A_{i+1}, \\ldots, A_{i+l-1}$$$ of the points array (for some $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n + 1 - l$$$), and some circle on the plane, containing $$$\\geq k$$$ points of the selected subsegment (inside or on the border). What is the smallest possible radius of that circle?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq k \\leq l \\leq n \\leq 50\\,000$$$, $$$k \\leq 20$$$). Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^8 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^8$$$) — the coordinates of the point $$$A_i$$$. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct and were generated independently from uniform distribution on $$$[-10^8, 10^8] \\times [-10^8, 10^8]$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$50\\,000$$$. In the first test, points were not generated from the uniform distribution on $$$[-10^8, 10^8] \\times [-10^8, 10^8]$$$ for simplicity. It is the only such test and your solution must pass it. Hacks are disabled in this problem.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single real number — the answer to the problem. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-9}$$$. Formally let your answer be $$$a$$$, jury answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer will be considered correct if $$$\\frac{|a - b|}{\\max{(1, |b|)}} \\le 10^{-9}$$$.",
