  "statement": "Lee couldn't sleep lately, because he had nightmares. In one of his nightmares (which was about an unbalanced global round), he decided to fight back and propose a problem below (which you should solve) to balance the round, hopefully setting him free from the nightmares. A non-empty array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ is called good , if there exist $$$m$$$ integer sequences which satisfy the following properties: The $$$i$$$-th sequence consists of $$$b_i$$$ consecutive integers (for example if $$$b_i = 3$$$ then the $$$i$$$-th sequence can be $$$(-1, 0, 1)$$$ or $$$(-5, -4, -3)$$$ but not $$$(0, -1, 1)$$$ or $$$(1, 2, 3, 4)$$$). Assuming the sum of integers in the $$$i$$$-th sequence is $$$sum_i$$$, we want $$$sum_1 + sum_2 + \\ldots + sum_m$$$ to be equal to $$$0$$$. You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. It has $$$2^n - 1$$$ nonempty subsequences. Find how many of them are good . As this number can be very large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. An array $$$c$$$ is a subsequence of an array $$$d$$$ if $$$c$$$ can be obtained from $$$d$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer — the number of nonempty good subsequences of $$$a$$$, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
