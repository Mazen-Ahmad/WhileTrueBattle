  "statement": "On the board Ivy wrote down all integers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$, inclusive. In an operation, she does the following: pick two numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ on the board, erase them, and in their place write the numbers $$$3x$$$ and $$$\\lfloor \\frac{y}{3} \\rfloor$$$. (Here $$$\\lfloor \\bullet \\rfloor$$$ denotes rounding down to the nearest integer). What is the minimum number of operations Ivy needs to make all numbers on the board equal $$$0$$$? We have a proof that this is always possible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l < r \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make all numbers on the board equal $$$0$$$.",
