  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ towers at $$$n$$$ distinct points $$$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)$$$, such that no three are collinear and no four are concyclic. Initially, you own towers $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$, and you want to capture all of them. To do this, you can do the following operation any number of times: Pick two towers $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ you own and one tower $$$R$$$ you don't own, such that the circle through $$$P$$$, $$$Q$$$, and $$$R$$$ contains all $$$n$$$ towers inside of it. Afterwards, capture all towers in or on triangle $$$\\triangle PQR$$$, including $$$R$$$ itself. An attack plan is a series of choices of $$$R$$$ ($$$R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_k$$$) using the above operations after which you capture all towers. Note that two attack plans are considered different only if they differ in their choice of $$$R$$$ in some operation; in particular, two attack plans using the same choices of $$$R$$$ but different choices of $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are considered the same. Count the number of attack plans of minimal length . Note that it might not be possible to capture all towers, in which case the answer is $$$0$$$. Since the answer may be large, output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 250$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the number of towers. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^4 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^4$$$) — the location of the $$$i$$$-th tower. Initially, you own towers $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$. All towers are at distinct locations, no three towers are collinear, and no four towers are concyclic. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of attack plans of minimal length after which you capture all towers, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
