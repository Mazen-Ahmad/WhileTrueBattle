  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ pairwise-distinct points and a line $$$x+y=k$$$ on a two-dimensional plane. The $$$i$$$-th point is at $$$(x_i,y_i)$$$. All points have non-negative coordinates and are strictly below the line. Alternatively, $$$0 \\leq x_i,y_i, x_i+y_i < k$$$. Tenzing wants to erase all the points. He can perform the following two operations: Draw triangle: Tenzing will choose two non-negative integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ that satisfy $$$a+b<k$$$, then all points inside the triangle formed by lines $$$x=a$$$, $$$y=b$$$ and $$$x+y=k$$$ will be erased. It can be shown that this triangle is an isosceles right triangle. Let the side lengths of the triangle be $$$l$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$\\sqrt 2 l$$$ respectively. Then, the cost of this operation is $$$l \\cdot A$$$. The blue area of the following picture describes the triangle with $$$a=1,b=1$$$ with cost $$$=1\\cdot A$$$. Erase a specific point: Tenzing will choose an integer $$$i$$$ that satisfies $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ and erase the point $$$i$$$. The cost of this operation is $$$c_i$$$. Help Tenzing find the minimum cost to erase all of the points.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$A$$$ ($$$1\\leq n,k\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\leq A\\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of points, the coefficient describing the hypotenuse of the triangle and the coefficient describing the cost of drawing a triangle. The following $$$n$$$ lines of the input the $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers $$$x_i,y_i,c_i$$$ ($$$0\\leq x_i,y_i,x_i+y_i< k$$$, $$$1\\leq c_i\\leq 10^4$$$) — the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th points and the cost of erasing it using the second operation. It is guaranteed that the coordinates are pairwise distinct.",
