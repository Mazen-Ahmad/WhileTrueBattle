  "statement": "Vanya has a graph with $$$n$$$ vertices (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$) and an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers; initially, there are no edges in the graph. Vanya got bored, and to have fun, he decided to perform $$$n - 1$$$ operations. Operation number $$$x$$$ (operations are numbered in order starting from $$$1$$$) is as follows: Choose $$$2$$$ different numbers $$$1 \\leq u,v \\leq n$$$, such that $$$|a_u - a_v|$$$ is divisible by $$$x$$$. Add an undirected edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ to the graph. Help Vanya get a connected$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ graph using the $$$n - 1$$$ operations, or determine that it is impossible. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A graph is called connected if it is possible to reach any vertex from any other by moving along the edges.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^{3}$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains the number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2000$$$) — the number of vertices in the graph. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\cdots a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if there is no solution, then output \" No \" (without quotes). Otherwise, output \" Yes \" (without quotes), and then output $$$n - 1$$$ lines, where in the $$$i$$$-th line, output the numbers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ that need to be chosen for operation $$$i$$$. You can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings \" yEs \", \" yes \", \" Yes \", and \" YES \" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
