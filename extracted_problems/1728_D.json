  "statement": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, they are given a non-empty string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string is even. Each player also has a string of their own, initially empty. Alice starts, then they alternate moves. In one move, a player takes either the first or the last letter of the string $$$s$$$, removes it from $$$s$$$ and prepends (adds to the beginning) it to their own string. The game ends when the string $$$s$$$ becomes empty. The winner is the player with a lexicographically smaller string. If the players' strings are equal, then it's a draw. A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if there exists such position $$$i$$$ that $$$a_j = b_j$$$ for all $$$j < i$$$ and $$$a_i < b_i$$$. What is the result of the game if both players play optimally (e. g. both players try to win; if they can't, then try to draw)?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of a single line — a non-empty string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string $$$s$$$ is even. The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each testcase, print the result of the game if both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print \"Alice\". If Bob wins, print \"Bob\". If it's a draw, print \"Draw\".",
