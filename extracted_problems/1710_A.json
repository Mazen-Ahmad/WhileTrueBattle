  "statement": "A picture can be represented as an $$$n\\times m$$$ grid ($$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns) so that each of the $$$n \\cdot m$$$ cells is colored with one color. You have $$$k$$$ pigments of different colors. You have a limited amount of each pigment, more precisely you can color at most $$$a_i$$$ cells with the $$$i$$$-th pigment. A picture is considered beautiful if each cell has at least $$$3$$$ toroidal neighbors with the same color as itself. Two cells are considered toroidal neighbors if they toroidally share an edge. In other words, for some integers $$$1 \\leq x_1,x_2 \\leq n$$$ and $$$1 \\leq y_1,y_2 \\leq m$$$, the cell in the $$$x_1$$$-th row and $$$y_1$$$-th column is a toroidal neighbor of the cell in the $$$x_2$$$-th row and $$$y_2$$$-th column if one of following two conditions holds: $$$x_1-x_2 \\equiv \\pm1 \\pmod{n}$$$ and $$$y_1=y_2$$$, or $$$y_1-y_2 \\equiv \\pm1 \\pmod{m}$$$ and $$$x_1=x_2$$$. Notice that each cell has exactly $$$4$$$ toroidal neighbors. For example, if $$$n=3$$$ and $$$m=4$$$, the toroidal neighbors of the cell $$$(1, 2)$$$ (the cell on the first row and second column) are: $$$(3, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 3)$$$, $$$(1, 1)$$$. They are shown in gray on the image below: The gray cells show toroidal neighbors of $$$(1, 2)$$$. Is it possible to color all cells with the pigments provided and create a beautiful picture?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n,m \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of rows and columns of the picture and the number of pigments. The next line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots, a_k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — $$$a_i$$$ is the maximum number of cells that can be colored with the $$$i$$$-th pigment. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
