  "statement": "A school has to decide on its team for an international quiz. There are $$$n$$$ students in the school. We can describe the students using an array $$$a$$$ where $$$a_i$$$ is the smartness of the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) student. There are $$$m$$$ topics $$$1, 2, 3, \\ldots, m$$$ from which the quiz questions will be formed. The $$$i$$$-th student is considered proficient in a topic $$$T$$$ if $$$(a_i \\bmod T) = 0$$$. Otherwise, he is a rookie in that topic. We say that a team of students is collectively proficient in all the topics if for every topic there is a member of the team proficient in this topic. Find a team that is collectively proficient in all the topics such that the maximum difference between the smartness of any two students in that team is minimized . Output this difference.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n,m \\le 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the answer on a new line. If there is no solution, output $$$-1$$$.",
