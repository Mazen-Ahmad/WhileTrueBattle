  "statement": "ChthollyNotaSeniorious gives DataStructures a number axis with $$$m$$$ distinct segments on it. Let $$$f(l,r)$$$ be the number of ways to choose an even number of segments such that the union of them is exactly $$$[l,r]$$$, and $$$g(l,r)$$$ be the number of ways to choose an odd number of segments such that the union of them is exactly $$$[l,r]$$$. ChthollyNotaSeniorious asked DataStructures $$$q$$$ questions. In each query, ChthollyNotaSeniorious will give DataStructures two numbers $$$l, r$$$, and now he wishes that you can help him find the value $$$f(l,r)-g(l,r)$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$ so that he wouldn't let her down.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains two integers $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of segments and queries, correspondingly. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i < y_i \\leq 10^9$$$), denoting a segment $$$[x_i, y_i]$$$. It is guaranteed that all segments are distinct. More formally, there do not exist two numbers $$$i, j$$$ with $$$1 \\le i < j \\le m$$$ such that $$$x_i = x_j$$$ and $$$y_i = y_j$$$. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i < r_i \\leq 10^9$$$), describing a query.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, output a single integer — $$$f(l_i,r_i)-g(l_i,r_i)$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
