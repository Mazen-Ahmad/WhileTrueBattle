  "statement": "This in an interactive problem . There is an unknown tree consisting of $$$n$$$ nodes, which has exactly one centroid. You only know $$$n$$$ at first, and your task is to find the centroid of the tree. You can ask the distance between any two vertices for at most $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$ times. Note that the interactor is not adaptive. That is, the tree is fixed in each test beforehand and does not depend on your queries. A vertex is called a centroid if its removal splits the tree into subtrees with at most $$$\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor$$$ vertices each.",
  "inputFormat": "The only line of the input contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3\\le n\\le 7.5\\cdot10^4$$$) â€” the number of nodes in the tree.",
