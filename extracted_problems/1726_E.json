  "statement": "A permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is called almost perfect if for all integer $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, it holds that $$$\\lvert p_i - p^{-1}_i \\rvert \\le 1$$$, where $$$p^{-1}$$$ is the inverse permutation of $$$p$$$ (i.e. $$$p^{-1}_{k_1} = k_2$$$ if and only if $$$p_{k_2} = k_1$$$). Count the number of almost perfect permutations of length $$$n$$$ modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows. The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of almost perfect permutations of length $$$n$$$ modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
