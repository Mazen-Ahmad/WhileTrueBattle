  "statement": "Given an integer $$$x$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$. In one operation, you can perform one of two actions: choose an integer $$$1 \\le a \\le k$$$ and assign $$$x = x \\cdot a$$$; choose an integer $$$1 \\le a \\le k$$$ and assign $$$x = \\frac{x}{a}$$$, where the value of $$$\\frac{x}{a}$$$ must be an integer. Find the minimum number of operations required to make the number $$$x$$$ equal to $$$y$$$, or determine that it is impossible.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y, k \\le 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$x$$$ and the sum of $$$y$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^8$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to achieve $$$x=y$$$ using the given operations, and the minimum number of required operations otherwise.",
