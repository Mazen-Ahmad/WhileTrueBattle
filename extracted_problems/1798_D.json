  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ consisting of integers such that $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n = 0$$$. You have to rearrange the elements of the array $$$a$$$ so that the following condition is satisfied: $$$$$$\\max\\limits_{1 \\le l \\le r \\le n} \\lvert a_l + a_{l+1} + \\ldots + a_r \\rvert < \\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) - \\min(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n),$$$$$$ where $$$|x|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$x$$$. More formally, determine if there exists a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ that for the array $$$a_{p_1}, a_{p_2}, \\ldots, a_{p_n}$$$, the condition above is satisfied, and find the corresponding array. Recall that the array $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ is called a permutation if for each integer $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ there is exactly one $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that $$$p_i = x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 50\\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 300\\,000$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of the array $$$a$$$ is zero, in other words: $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n = 0$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$300\\,000$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is impossible to rearrange the elements of the array $$$a$$$ in the required way, print \" No \" in a single line. If possible, print \" Yes \" in the first line, and then in a separate line $$$n$$$ numbers — elements $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ rearranged in a valid order ($$$a_{p_1}, a_{p_2}, \\ldots, a_{p_n}$$$). If there are several possible answers, you can output any of them.",
