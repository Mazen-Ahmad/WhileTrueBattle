  "statement": "You are given a matrix of integers with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. The cell at the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column contains the number $$$a_{ij}$$$. You can perform the following operation exactly once : Choose two numbers $$$1 \\leq r \\leq n$$$ and $$$1 \\leq c \\leq m$$$. For all cells $$$(i, j)$$$ in the matrix such that $$$i = r$$$ or $$$j = c$$$, decrease $$$a_{ij}$$$ by one. You need to find the minimal possible maximum value in the matrix $$$a$$$ after performing exactly one such operation.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of rows and columns in the matrix. The next $$$n$$$ lines of each test case describe the matrix $$$a$$$. The $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i1}, a_{i2}, \\ldots, a_{im}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_{ij} \\leq 100$$$) — the elements in the $$$i$$$-th row of the matrix. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the minimum maximum value in the matrix $$$a$$$ after performing exactly one operation.",
