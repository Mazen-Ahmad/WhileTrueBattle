  "statement": "Ashish has a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ containing only characters ' a ', ' b ' and ' c '. He wants to find the length of the smallest substring, which satisfies the following conditions: Length of the substring is at least $$$2$$$ ' a ' occurs strictly more times in this substring than ' b ' ' a ' occurs strictly more times in this substring than ' c ' Ashish is busy planning his next Codeforces round. Help him solve the problem. A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\le t \\le 10^{5})$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \\le n \\le 10^{6})$$$ — the length of the string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters ' a ', ' b ' and ' c '. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^{6}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the length of the smallest substring which satisfies the given conditions or print $$$-1$$$ if there is no such substring.",
