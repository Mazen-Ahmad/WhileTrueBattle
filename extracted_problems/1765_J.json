  "statement": "There are no heroes in this problem. I guess we should have named it \"To Zero\". You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, each of these arrays contains $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. Let $$$c$$$ be a matrix of size $$$n \\times n$$$ such that $$$c_{i,j} = |a_i - b_j|$$$ for every $$$i \\in [1, n]$$$ and every $$$j \\in [1, n]$$$. Your goal is to transform the matrix $$$c$$$ so that it becomes the zero matrix, i. e. a matrix where every element is exactly $$$0$$$. In order to do so, you may perform the following operations any number of times, in any order: choose an integer $$$i$$$, then decrease $$$c_{i,j}$$$ by $$$1$$$ for every $$$j \\in [1, n]$$$ (i. e. decrease all elements in the $$$i$$$-th row by $$$1$$$). In order to perform this operation, you pay $$$1$$$ coin; choose an integer $$$j$$$, then decrease $$$c_{i,j}$$$ by $$$1$$$ for every $$$i \\in [1, n]$$$ (i. e. decrease all elements in the $$$j$$$-th column by $$$1$$$). In order to perform this operation, you pay $$$1$$$ coin; choose two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, then decrease $$$c_{i,j}$$$ by $$$1$$$. In order to perform this operation, you pay $$$1$$$ coin; choose an integer $$$i$$$, then increase $$$c_{i,j}$$$ by $$$1$$$ for every $$$j \\in [1, n]$$$ (i. e. increase all elements in the $$$i$$$-th row by $$$1$$$). When you perform this operation, you receive $$$1$$$ coin; choose an integer $$$j$$$, then increase $$$c_{i,j}$$$ by $$$1$$$ for every $$$i \\in [1, n]$$$ (i. e. increase all elements in the $$$j$$$-th column by $$$1$$$). When you perform this operation, you receive $$$1$$$ coin. You have to calculate the minimum number of coins required to transform the matrix $$$c$$$ into the zero matrix. Note that all elements of $$$c$$$ should be equal to $$$0$$$ simultaneously after the operations.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^8$$$). The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le b_j \\le 10^8$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print one integer — the minimum number of coins required to transform the matrix $$$c$$$ into the zero matrix.",
