  "statement": "An array is beautiful if both of the following two conditions meet: there are at least $$$l_1$$$ and at most $$$r_1$$$ elements in the array equal to its minimum; there are at least $$$l_2$$$ and at most $$$r_2$$$ elements in the array equal to its maximum. For example, the array $$$[2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 2]$$$ has $$$3$$$ elements equal to its minimum ($$$1$$$-st, $$$3$$$-rd and $$$7$$$-th) and $$$2$$$ elements equal to its maximum ($$$4$$$-th and $$$5$$$-th). Another example: the array $$$[42, 42, 42]$$$ has $$$3$$$ elements equal to its minimum and $$$3$$$ elements equal to its maximum. Your task is to calculate the minimum possible number of elements in a beautiful array.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing four integers $$$l_1$$$, $$$r_1$$$, $$$l_2$$$ and $$$r_2$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_1 \\le r_1 \\le 50$$$; $$$1 \\le l_2 \\le r_2 \\le 50$$$).",
