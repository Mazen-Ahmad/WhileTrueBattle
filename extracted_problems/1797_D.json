  "statement": "Li Hua has a tree of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n-1$$$ edges. The root of the tree is vertex $$$1$$$. Each vertex $$$i$$$ has importance $$$a_i$$$. Denote the size of a subtree as the number of vertices in it, and the importance as the sum of the importance of vertices in it. Denote the heavy son of a non-leaf vertex as the son with the largest subtree size . If multiple of them exist, the heavy son is the one with the minimum index. Li Hua wants to perform $$$m$$$ operations: \"1 $$$x$$$\" ($$$1\\leq x \\leq n$$$) — calculate the importance of the subtree whose root is $$$x$$$. \"2 $$$x$$$\" ($$$2\\leq x \\leq n$$$) — rotate the heavy son of $$$x$$$ up. Formally, denote $$$son_x$$$ as the heavy son of $$$x$$$, $$$fa_x$$$ as the father of $$$x$$$. He wants to remove the edge between $$$x$$$ and $$$fa_x$$$ and connect an edge between $$$son_x$$$ and $$$fa_x$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$x$$$ is not root, but not guaranteed that $$$x$$$ is not a leaf. If $$$x$$$ is a leaf, please ignore the operation. Suppose you were Li Hua, please solve this problem.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains 2 integers $$$n,m$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 10^{5},1\\le m\\le 10^{5}$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of operations. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots ,a_{n}$$$ ($$$-10^{9}\\le a_{i}\\le 10^{9}$$$) — the importance of each vertex. Next $$$n-1$$$ lines contain the edges of the tree. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1\\le u_i,v_i\\le n$$$, $$$u_i\\ne v_i$$$) — the corresponding edge. The given edges form a tree. Next $$$m$$$ lines contain operations — one operation per line. The $$$j$$$-th operation contains two integers $$$t_{j},x_{j}$$$ ($$$t_{j}\\in \\{1,2\\}$$$, $$$1 \\leq x_{j} \\leq n$$$, $$$x_{j}\\neq 1$$$ if $$$t_j = 2$$$) — the $$$j$$$-th operation.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query \"1 $$$x$$$\", output the answer in an independent line.",
