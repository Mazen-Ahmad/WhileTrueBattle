  "statement": "Monocarp is going to register on the Codeforces website, but he can't come up with a sufficiently secure password. The requirements that his password must meet are as follows: the password must consist of digits, as well as uppercase and lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet; there must be exactly $$$a$$$ digits, exactly $$$b$$$ uppercase letters, and exactly $$$c$$$ lowercase letters; for security, no two adjacent characters in the password should be the same. The lowercase and uppercase versions of the same letter are considered different characters. Write a program that generates a password that meets all the requirements.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b, c \\le 10$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one line containing any suitable password. It can be shown that there is always at least one password that meets the requirements.",
