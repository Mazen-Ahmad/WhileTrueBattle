  "statement": "There is a road, which can be represented as a number line. You are located in the point $$$0$$$ of the number line, and you want to travel from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$x$$$, and back to the point $$$0$$$. You travel by car, which spends $$$1$$$ liter of gasoline per $$$1$$$ unit of distance travelled. When you start at the point $$$0$$$, your car is fully fueled (its gas tank contains the maximum possible amount of fuel). There are $$$n$$$ gas stations, located in points $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. When you arrive at a gas station, you fully refuel your car. Note that you can refuel only at gas stations, and there are no gas stations in points $$$0$$$ and $$$x$$$ . You have to calculate the minimum possible volume of the gas tank in your car (in liters) that will allow you to travel from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$x$$$ and back to the point $$$0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$; $$$2 \\le x \\le 100$$$); the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 < a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < a_n < x$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible volume of the gas tank in your car that will allow you to travel from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$x$$$ and back.",
