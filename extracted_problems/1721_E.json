  "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You are asked $$$q$$$ queries about it: given another string $$$t$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, perform the following steps: concatenate $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$; calculate the prefix function of the resulting string $$$s+t$$$; print the values of the prefix function on positions $$$|s|+1, |s|+2, \\dots, |s|+|t|$$$ ($$$|s|$$$ and $$$|t|$$$ denote the lengths of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, respectively); revert the string back to $$$s$$$. The prefix function of a string $$$a$$$ is a sequence $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{|a|}$$$, where $$$p_i$$$ is the maximum value of $$$k$$$ such that $$$k < i$$$ and $$$a[1..k]=a[i-k+1..i]$$$ ($$$a[l..r]$$$ denotes a contiguous substring of a string $$$a$$$ from a position $$$l$$$ to a position $$$r$$$, inclusive). In other words, it's the longest proper prefix of the string $$$a[1..i]$$$ that is equal to its suffix of the same length.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a non-empty string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 10^6$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The second line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$) â€” the number of queries. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains a query: a non-empty string $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le |t| \\le 10$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print the values of the prefix function of a string $$$s+t$$$ on positions $$$|s|+1, |s|+2, \\dots, |s|+|t|$$$.",
