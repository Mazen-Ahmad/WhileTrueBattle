  "statement": "You are given 2 arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of size $$$n$$$. You can swap two elements in $$$b$$$ at most once (or leave it as it is), and you are required to minimize the value $$$$$$\\sum_{i}|a_{i}-b_{i}|.$$$$$$ Find the minimum possible value of this sum.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le {10^9}$$$). The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le {10^9}$$$).",
