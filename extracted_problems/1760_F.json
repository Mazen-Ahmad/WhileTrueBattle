  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ quests. If you complete the $$$i$$$-th quest, you will gain $$$a_i$$$ coins. You can only complete at most one quest per day. However, once you complete a quest, you cannot do the same quest again for $$$k$$$ days. (For example, if $$$k=2$$$ and you do quest $$$1$$$ on day $$$1$$$, then you cannot do it on day $$$2$$$ or $$$3$$$, but you can do it again on day $$$4$$$.) You are given two integers $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$. Find the maximum value of $$$k$$$ such that you can gain at least $$$c$$$ coins over $$$d$$$ days. If no such $$$k$$$ exists, output Impossible . If $$$k$$$ can be arbitrarily large, output Infinity .",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n,c,d$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$$$; $$$1 \\leq c \\leq 10^{16}$$$; $$$1 \\leq d \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of quests, the number of coins you need, and the number of days. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the rewards for the quests. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$d$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one of the following. If no such $$$k$$$ exists, output Impossible . If $$$k$$$ can be arbitrarily large, output Infinity . Otherwise, output a single integer — the maximum value of $$$k$$$ such that you can gain at least $$$c$$$ coins over $$$d$$$ days. Please note, the checker is case-sensitive , and you should output strings exactly as they are given.",
