  "statement": "Given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, determine the lexicographically largest$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ subsequence$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ $$$s$$$ of $$$a$$$ such that $$$s$$$ can be the side lengths of a polygon. Recall that $$$s$$$ can be the side lengths of a polygon if and only if $$$|s| \\geq 3$$$ and $$$$$$ 2 \\cdot \\max(s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{|s|}) < s_1 + s_2 + \\ldots + s_{|s|}. $$$$$$ If no such subsequence $$$s$$$ exists, print $$$-1$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a sequence $$$y$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$x$$$ is a prefix of $$$y$$$, but $$$x \\ne y$$$; in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, the sequence $$$x$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$y$$$. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deleting several (possibly zero or all) elements.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the total sum of all values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the answer in the following format: If the answer exists, output the following. In the first line, output the integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$) — the length of the subsequence $$$s$$$. In the second line, output $$$k$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s_i \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$s$$$ is a subsequence of $$$a$$$) — the subsequence $$$s$$$. Note that the desired output is the value, not the index. Otherwise, output a single line with the integer $$$-1$$$.",
