  "statement": "Given an integer $$$n$$$, find the maximum value of integer $$$k$$$ such that the following condition holds: $$$n$$$ & ($$$n-1$$$) & ($$$n-2$$$) & ($$$n-3$$$) & ... ($$$k$$$) = $$$0$$$ where & denotes the bitwise AND operation.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 3 \\cdot 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer â€” the required integer $$$k$$$.",
