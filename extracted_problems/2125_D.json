  "statement": "There is a linear strip divided into $$$m$$$ cells, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. You are given $$$n$$$ segments. Each segment is defined by four numbers: $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ — the segment covers cells from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusively and exists with probability $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$ (independently). Your task is to calculate the probability that each cell is covered by exactly one segment.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains four integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, $$$p_i$$$ and $$$q_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le m$$$; $$$1 \\le p_i < q_i < 998244353$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer — the probability that each cell is covered by exactly one segment, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$. Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.",
