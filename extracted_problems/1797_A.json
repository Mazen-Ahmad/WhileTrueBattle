  "statement": "There is a rectangular maze of size $$$n\\times m$$$. Denote $$$(r,c)$$$ as the cell on the $$$r$$$-th row from the top and the $$$c$$$-th column from the left. Two cells are adjacent if they share an edge. A path is a sequence of adjacent empty cells. Each cell is initially empty. Li Hua can choose some cells (except $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$) and place an obstacle in each of them. He wants to know the minimum number of obstacles needed to be placed so that there isn't a path from $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$. Suppose you were Li Hua, please solve this problem.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,m$$$ ($$$4\\le n,m\\le 10^9$$$) — the size of the maze. The second line of each test case contains four integers $$$x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2$$$ ($$$1\\le x_1,x_2\\le n, 1\\le y_1,y_2\\le m$$$) — the coordinates of the start and the end. It is guaranteed that $$$|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|\\ge 2$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print the minimum number of obstacles you need to put on the field so that there is no path from $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$.",
