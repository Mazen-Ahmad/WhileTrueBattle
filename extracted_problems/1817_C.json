  "statement": "A polynomial $$$A(x)$$$ of degree $$$d$$$ is an expression of the form $$$A(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\dots + a_d x^d$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ are integers, and $$$a_d \\neq 0$$$. Two polynomials $$$A(x)$$$ and $$$B(x)$$$ are called similar if there is an integer $$$s$$$ such that for any integer $$$x$$$ it holds that $$$$$$ B(x) \\equiv A(x+s) \\pmod{10^9+7}. $$$$$$ For two similar polynomials $$$A(x)$$$ and $$$B(x)$$$ of degree $$$d$$$, you're given their values in the points $$$x=0,1,\\dots, d$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. Find a value $$$s$$$ such that $$$B(x) \\equiv A(x+s) \\pmod{10^9+7}$$$ for all integers $$$x$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\le d \\le 2\\,500\\,000$$$). The second line contains $$$d+1$$$ integers $$$A(0), A(1), \\ldots, A(d)$$$ ($$$0 \\le A(i) < 10^9+7$$$) — the values of the polynomial $$$A(x)$$$. The third line contains $$$d+1$$$ integers $$$B(0), B(1), \\ldots, B(d)$$$ ($$$0 \\le B(i) < 10^9+7$$$) — the values of the polynomial $$$B(x)$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$A(x)$$$ and $$$B(x)$$$ are similar and that the leading coefficients (i.e., the coefficients in front of $$$x^d$$$) of $$$A(x)$$$ and $$$B(x)$$$ are not divisible by $$$10^9+7$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "Print a single integer $$$s$$$ ($$$0 \\leq s < 10^9+7$$$) such that $$$B(x) \\equiv A(x+s) \\pmod{10^9+7}$$$ for all integers $$$x$$$. If there are multiple solutions, print any.",
