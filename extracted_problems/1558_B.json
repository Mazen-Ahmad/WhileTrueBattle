  "statement": "Note that the memory limit in this problem is lower than in others. You have a vertical strip with $$$n$$$ cells, numbered consecutively from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom. You also have a token that is initially placed in cell $$$n$$$. You will move the token up until it arrives at cell $$$1$$$. Let the token be in cell $$$x > 1$$$ at some moment. One shift of the token can have either of the following kinds: Subtraction: you choose an integer $$$y$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$x-1$$$, inclusive, and move the token from cell $$$x$$$ to cell $$$x - y$$$. Floored division: you choose an integer $$$z$$$ between $$$2$$$ and $$$x$$$, inclusive, and move the token from cell $$$x$$$ to cell $$$\\lfloor \\frac{x}{z} \\rfloor$$$ ($$$x$$$ divided by $$$z$$$ rounded down). Find the number of ways to move the token from cell $$$n$$$ to cell $$$1$$$ using one or more shifts, and print it modulo $$$m$$$. Note that if there are several ways to move the token from one cell to another in one shift, all these ways are considered distinct (check example explanation for a better understanding).",
  "inputFormat": "The only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 4 \\cdot 10^6$$$; $$$10^8 < m < 10^9$$$; $$$m$$$ is a prime number) â€” the length of the strip and the modulo.",
  "outputFormat": "Print the number of ways to move the token from cell $$$n$$$ to cell $$$1$$$, modulo $$$m$$$.",
