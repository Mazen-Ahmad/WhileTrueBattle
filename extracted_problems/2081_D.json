  "statement": "You are given a complete graph with $$$n$$$ vertices, where the $$$i$$$-th vertex has a weight $$$p_i$$$. The weight of the edge connecting vertex $$$x$$$ and vertex $$$y$$$ is equal to $$$\\operatorname{max}(p_x, p_y) \\bmod \\operatorname{min}(p_x, p_y)$$$. Find the smallest total weight of a set of $$$n - 1$$$ edges that connect all $$$n$$$ vertices in this graph.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The next line of each test contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$. The sum of $$$\\max(p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n)$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer â€” the weight of the minimum spanning tree.",
