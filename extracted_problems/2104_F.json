  "statement": "For each integer $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, we will form the string $$$S(x)$$$ according to the following rules: compute $$$(x+1)$$$; write $$$x$$$ and $$$x+1$$$ next to each other in the decimal system without separators and leading zeros; in the resulting string, sort all digits in non-decreasing order. For example, the string $$$S(139)$$$ is 011349 (before sorting the digits, it is 139140 ). The string $$$S(99)$$$ is 00199 . Your task is to count the number of distinct strings among $$$S(1), S(2), \\dots, S(n)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{9} - 2$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of distinct strings among $$$S(1), S(2), \\dots, S(n)$$$.",
