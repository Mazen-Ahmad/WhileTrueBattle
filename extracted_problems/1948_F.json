  "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ bags numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th bag contains $$$a_i$$$ golden coins and $$$b_i$$$ silver coins. The value of a gold coin is $$$1$$$. The value of a silver coin is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$, determined for each silver coin independently ($$$0$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$, $$$1$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$). You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries. Each query is the following: $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ — calculate the probability that the total value of coins in bags from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is strictly greater than the total value in all other bags.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of bags and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$) — the number of gold coins in the $$$i$$$-th bag. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le b_i \\le 10^6$$$) — the number of silver coins in the $$$i$$$-th bag. Next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries. The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_j$$$ and $$$r_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_j \\le r_j \\le n$$$) — the description of the $$$j$$$-th query. Additional constraints on the input: the sum of the array $$$a$$$ doesn't exceed $$$10^6$$$; the sum of the array $$$b$$$ doesn't exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each query, print one integer — the probability that the total value of coins in bags from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is strictly greater than the total value in all other bags, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$. Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.",
