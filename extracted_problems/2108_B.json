  "statement": "On a recent birthday, your best friend Maurice gave you a pair of numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$, and asked you to construct an array of positive numbers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus a_n = x$$$ $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. This task seemed too simple to you, and therefore you decided to give Maurice a return gift by constructing an array among all such arrays that has the smallest sum of its elements. You immediately thought of a suitable array; however, since writing it down turned out to be too time-consuming, Maurice will have to settle for just the sum of its elements. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation .",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. Each test case consists of a single line containing a pair of numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9, \\; 0 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$) — the numbers given to you by Maurice.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output your gift to Maurice — the sum of the elements of the array that satisfies all the described properties. If a suitable array does not exist, output $$$-1$$$.",
