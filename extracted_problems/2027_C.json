  "statement": "You're given an array $$$a$$$ initially containing $$$n$$$ integers. In one operation, you must do the following: Choose a position $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 < i \\le |a|$$$ and $$$a_i = |a| + 1 - i$$$, where $$$|a|$$$ is the current size of the array. Append $$$i - 1$$$ zeros onto the end of $$$a$$$. After performing this operation as many times as you want, what is the maximum possible length of the array $$$a$$$?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{12}$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible length of $$$a$$$ after performing some sequence of operations.",
