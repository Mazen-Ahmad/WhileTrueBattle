  "statement": "On Penacony, The Land of the Dreams , there exists $$$n$$$ houses and $$$n$$$ roads. There exists a road between house $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$$$ and a road between house $$$n$$$ and house $$$1$$$. All roads are bidirectional. However, due to the crisis on Penacony, the overseeing family has gone into debt and may not be able to maintain all roads. There are $$$m$$$ pairs of friendships between the residents of Penacony. If the resident living in house $$$a$$$ is friends with the resident living in house $$$b$$$, there must be a path between houses $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ through maintained roads. What is the minimum number of roads that must be maintained?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) – the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\leq m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) – the number of houses and the number of friendships. The next $$$m$$$ lines contain two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a < b \\leq n$$$) – the resident in house $$$a$$$ is friends with the resident in house $$$b$$$. It is guaranteed all ($$$a, b$$$) are distinct. It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output an integer, the minimum number of roads that must be maintained.",
