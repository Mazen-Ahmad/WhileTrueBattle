  "statement": "Arul has a binary array$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He will take all subsequences$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ of length $$$k$$$ ($$$k$$$ is odd) of this array and find their median.$$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$ What is the sum of all these values? As this sum can be very large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. In other words, print the remainder of this sum when divided by $$$10^9 + 7$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A binary array is an array consisting only of zeros and ones. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$An array $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. Subsequences don't have to be contiguous. $$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$The median of an array of odd length $$$k$$$ is the $$$\\frac{k+1}{2}$$$-th element when sorted.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$k$$$ is odd ) — the length of the array and the length of the subsequence, respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 1$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
