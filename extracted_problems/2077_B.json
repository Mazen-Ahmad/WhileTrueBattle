  "statement": "ALTER EGO - Yuta Imai vs Qlarabelle This is an interactive problem. There are two hidden non-negative integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$0 \\leq x, y < 2^{30}$$$). You can ask no more than $$$2$$$ queries of the following form. Pick a non-negative integer $$$n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq n < 2^{30}$$$). The judge will respond with the value of $$$(n \\mathbin{|} x) + (n \\mathbin{|} y)$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation . After this, the judge will give you another non-negative integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\leq m < 2^{30}$$$). You must answer the correct value of $$$(m \\mathbin{|} x) + (m \\mathbin{|} y)$$$.",
