  "statement": "A new entertainment has appeared in Buryatia — a mathematical circus! The magician shows two numbers to the audience — $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, where $$$n$$$ is even . Next, he takes all the integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and splits them all into pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ (each integer must be in exactly one pair) so that for each pair the integer $$$(a + k) \\cdot b$$$ is divisible by $$$4$$$ ( note that the order of the numbers in the pair matters ), or reports that, unfortunately for viewers, such a split is impossible. Burenka really likes such performances, so she asked her friend Tonya to be a magician, and also gave him the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Tonya is a wolf, and as you know, wolves do not perform in the circus, even in a mathematical one. Therefore, he asks you to help him. Let him know if a suitable splitting into pairs is possible, and if possible, then tell it.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following is a description of the input data sets. The single line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$n$$$ is even) — the number of integers and the number being added $$$k$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, first output the string \" YES \" if there is a split into pairs, and \" NO \" if there is none. If there is a split, then in the following $$$\\frac{n}{2}$$$ lines output pairs of the split, in each line print $$$2$$$ numbers — first the integer $$$a$$$, then the integer $$$b$$$.",
