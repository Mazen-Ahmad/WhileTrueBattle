  "statement": "You are given two positive (greater than zero) integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. There is a variable $$$k$$$ initially set to $$$0$$$. You can perform the following two types of operations: add $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ (i. e. assign $$$k := k + 1$$$); add $$$x \\cdot 10^{p}$$$ to $$$k$$$ for some non-negative $$$p$$$ (i. e. assign $$$k := k + x \\cdot 10^{p}$$$ for some $$$p \\ge 0$$$). Find the minimum number of operations described above to set the value of $$$k$$$ to $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing two integer $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le 10^9$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations to set the value of $$$k$$$ to $$$y$$$.",
