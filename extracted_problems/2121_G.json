  "statement": "You are given a binary string $$$s_1s_2 \\ldots s_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. A string $$$s$$$ is called binary if it consists only of zeros and ones. For a string $$$p$$$, we define the function $$$f(p)$$$ as the maximum number of occurrences of any character in the string $$$p$$$. For example, $$$f(00110) = 3$$$, $$$f(01) = 1$$$. You need to find the sum $$$f(s_ls_{l+1} \\ldots s_r)$$$ for all pairs $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows their descriptions. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the binary string. The second line of each test case contains a string of length $$$n$$$, consisting of $$$0$$$s and $$$1$$$s — the binary string $$$s$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
