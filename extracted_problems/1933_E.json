  "statement": "Isaac begins his training. There are $$$n$$$ running tracks available, and the $$$i$$$-th track ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) consists of $$$a_i$$$ equal-length sections. Given an integer $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\le u \\le 10^9$$$), finishing each section can increase Isaac's ability by a certain value, described as follows: Finishing the $$$1$$$-st section increases Isaac's performance by $$$u$$$. Finishing the $$$2$$$-nd section increases Isaac's performance by $$$u-1$$$. Finishing the $$$3$$$-rd section increases Isaac's performance by $$$u-2$$$. $$$\\ldots$$$ Finishing the $$$k$$$-th section ($$$k \\ge 1$$$) increases Isaac's performance by $$$u+1-k$$$. (The value $$$u+1-k$$$ can be negative, which means finishing an extra section decreases Isaac's performance.) You are also given an integer $$$l$$$. You must choose an integer $$$r$$$ such that $$$l \\le r \\le n$$$ and Isaac will finish each section of each track $$$l, l + 1, \\dots, r$$$ (that is, a total of $$$\\sum_{i=l}^r a_i = a_l + a_{l+1} + \\ldots + a_r$$$ sections). Answer the following question: what is the optimal $$$r$$$ you can choose that the increase in Isaac's performance is maximum possible? If there are multiple $$$r$$$ that maximize the increase in Isaac's performance, output the smallest $$$r$$$. To increase the difficulty, you need to answer the question for $$$q$$$ different values of $$$l$$$ and $$$u$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^4$$$). The third line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$). The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le n, 1 \\le u \\le 10^9$$$) — the descriptions to each query. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. The sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output $$$q$$$ integers: the $$$i$$$-th integer contains the optimal $$$r$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th query. If there are multiple solutions, output the smallest one.",
