  "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version, $$$a_i \\le 10^9$$$. For a given sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a$$$, a triple $$$(i, j, k)$$$ is called magic if: $$$1 \\le i, j, k \\le n$$$. $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ are pairwise distinct. there exists a positive integer $$$b$$$ such that $$$a_i \\cdot b = a_j$$$ and $$$a_j \\cdot b = a_k$$$. Kolya received a sequence of integers $$$a$$$ as a gift and now wants to count the number of magic triples for it. Help him with this task! Note that there are no constraints on the order of integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$k$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of the test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence. The second line of the test contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the sequence $$$a$$$. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the number of magic triples for the sequence $$$a$$$.",
