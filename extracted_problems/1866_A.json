  "statement": "Chaneka, Pak Chanek's child, is an ambitious kid, so Pak Chanek gives her the following problem to test her ambition. Given an array of integers $$$[A_1, A_2, A_3, \\ldots, A_N]$$$. In one operation, Chaneka can choose one element, then increase or decrease the element's value by $$$1$$$. Chaneka can do that operation multiple times, even for different elements. What is the minimum number of operations that must be done to make it such that $$$A_1 \\times A_2 \\times A_3 \\times \\ldots \\times A_N = 0$$$?",
