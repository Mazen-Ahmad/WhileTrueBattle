  "statement": "There are two screens which can display sequences of uppercase Latin letters. Initially, both screens display nothing. In one second, you can do one of the following two actions: choose a screen and an uppercase Latin letter, and append that letter to the end of the sequence displayed on that screen; choose a screen and copy the sequence from it to the other screen, overwriting the sequence that was displayed on the other screen . You have to calculate the minimum number of seconds you have to spend so that the first screen displays the sequence $$$s$$$, and the second screen displays the sequence $$$t$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the string $$$s$$$, and the second line contains the string $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s|, |t| \\le 100$$$). Both strings consist of uppercase Latin letters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible number of seconds you have to spend so that the first screen displays the sequence $$$s$$$, and the second screen displays the sequence $$$t$$$.",
