  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of positive integers. Find the number of pairs of indices $$$(l, r)$$$, where $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, that pass the check. The check is performed in the following manner: The minimum and maximum numbers are found among $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$. The check is passed if the maximum number is divisible by the minimum number.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the number of pairs of indices that pass the check.",
