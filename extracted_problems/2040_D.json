  "statement": "You are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. You need to construct an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of unique integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$2 \\cdot n$$$, and such that for each edge $$$u_i \\leftrightarrow v_i$$$ of the tree, the value $$$|a_{u_i} - a_{v_i}|$$$ is not a prime number. Find any array that satisfies these conditions, or report that there is no such array.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree. The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain the edges of the tree, one edge per line. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$$$; $$$u_i \\neq v_i$$$), denoting the edge between the nodes $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if an array that satisfies the conditions exists, print its elements $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$.",
