  "statement": "You have an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ consisting only of zeroes and ones and an integer $$$k$$$. In one operation you can do one of the following: Select $$$2$$$ consecutive elements of $$$a$$$ and replace them with their minimum (that is, let $$$a := [a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{i-1}, \\min(a_{i}, a_{i+1}), a_{i+2}, \\ldots, a_{n}]$$$ for some $$$1 \\le i \\le n-1$$$). This operation decreases the size of $$$a$$$ by $$$1$$$. Select $$$k$$$ consecutive elements of $$$a$$$ and replace them with their maximum (that is, let $$$a := [a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{i-1}, \\max(a_{i}, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_{i+k-1}), a_{i+k}, \\ldots, a_{n}]$$$ for some $$$1 \\le i \\le n-k+1$$$). This operation decreases the size of $$$a$$$ by $$$k-1$$$. Determine if it's possible to turn $$$a$$$ into $$$[1]$$$ after several (possibly zero) operations.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le k \\le n \\le 50$$$), the size of array $$$a$$$ and the length of segments that you can perform second type operation on. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$$$ ($$$a_i$$$ is $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$), elements of array $$$a$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if it is possible to turn $$$a$$$ into $$$[1]$$$, print \" YES \", otherwise print \" NO \".",
