  "statement": "This is a hard version of the problem. The constraints of $$$t$$$, $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ are the only difference between versions. You have a device with two CPUs. You also have $$$k$$$ programs, numbered $$$1$$$ through $$$k$$$, that you can run on the CPUs. The $$$i$$$-th program ($$$1 \\le i \\le k$$$) takes $$$cold_i$$$ seconds to run on some CPU. However, if the last program we ran on this CPU was also program $$$i$$$, it only takes $$$hot_i$$$ seconds ($$$hot_i \\le cold_i$$$). Note that this only applies if we run program $$$i$$$ multiple times consecutively â€” if we run program $$$i$$$, then some different program, then program $$$i$$$ again, it will take $$$cold_i$$$ seconds the second time. You are given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$. You need to use your device to run programs $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ in sequence. For all $$$2 \\le i \\le n$$$, you cannot start running program $$$a_i$$$ until program $$$a_{i - 1}$$$ has completed. Find the minimum amount of time needed to run all programs $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ in sequence.",
  "inputFormat": "Input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$, the number of test cases ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le k$$$). The third line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$cold_1, cold_2, \\ldots, cold_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le cold_i \\le 10^9$$$). The fourth line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$hot_1, hot_2, \\ldots, hot_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le hot_i \\le cold_i$$$). It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print the minimum time needed to run all programs in the given order.",
