  "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ with $$$n$$$ integers. You can perform the following operation at most $$$k$$$ times: Choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, in which $$$i \\,\\bmod\\, k = j \\,\\bmod\\, k$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$). Swap $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$. After performing all operations, you have to select $$$k$$$ consecutive elements, and the sum of the $$$k$$$ elements becomes your score. Find the maximum score you can get. Here $$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 600$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the array and the number in the statement above. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array itself.",
