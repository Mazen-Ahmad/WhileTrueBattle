  "statement": "Given a string $$$s$$$ that consists only of the first three letters of the Latin alphabet, meaning each character of the string is either a , b , or c . Also given are $$$q$$$ operations that need to be performed on the string. In each operation, two letters $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ from the set of the first three letters of the Latin alphabet are provided, and for each operation, one of the following two actions must be taken: change any (one) occurrence of the letter $$$x$$$ in the string $$$s$$$ to the letter $$$y$$$ (if at least one occurrence of the letter $$$x$$$ exists); do nothing. The goal is to perform all operations in the given order in such a way that the string $$$s$$$ becomes lexicographically minimal. Recall that a string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following conditions holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\neq b$$$; at the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that comes earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^{3}$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. In the first line of each test case, there are two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$ and the number of operations. In the second line of each test case, the string $$$s$$$ is given — a string of exactly $$$n$$$ characters, each of which is a , b , or c . The next $$$q$$$ lines of each test case contain the description of the operations. Each line contains two characters $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, each of which is a , b , or c . Additional constraints on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$; the sum of $$$q$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the lexicographically minimal string that can be obtained from $$$s$$$ using the given operations.",
