  "statement": "Pasha loves prime numbers$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$! Once again, in his attempts to find a new way to generate prime numbers, he became interested in an algorithm he found on the internet: To obtain a new number $$$y$$$, repeat $$$k$$$ times the decimal representation of the number $$$x$$$ (without leading zeros). For example, for $$$x = 52$$$ and $$$k = 3$$$, we get $$$y = 525252$$$, and for $$$x = 6$$$ and $$$k = 7$$$, we get $$$y = 6666666$$$. Pasha really wants the resulting number $$$y$$$ to be prime, but he doesn't yet know how to check the primality of numbers generated by this algorithm. Help Pasha and tell him whether $$$y$$$ is prime! $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An integer $$$x$$$ is considered prime if it has exactly $$$2$$$ distinct divisors: $$$1$$$ and $$$x$$$. For example, $$$13$$$ is prime because it has only $$$2$$$ divisors: $$$1$$$ and $$$13$$$. Note that the number $$$1$$$ is not prime, as it has only one divisor.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of sets of input data. The following lines describe the sets of input data. The first and only line of each data set contains two integers: $$$x$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 7$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each set of input data, output «YES» (without quotes) if the resulting number $$$y$$$ will be prime, and «NO» otherwise. You may output «Yes» and «No» in any case (for example, the strings «yES» , «yes» , and «Yes» will be recognized as positive answers).",
