  "statement": "There is an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers, and a positive integer $$$k$$$. An array $$$b$$$ is created from array $$$a$$$ according to the following rules: $$$b$$$ contains $$$n \\cdot k$$$ numbers; the first $$$n$$$ numbers of array $$$b$$$ are the same as the numbers of array $$$a$$$, that is, $$$b_{i} = a_{i}$$$ for $$$i \\le n$$$; for any $$$i > n$$$, it holds that $$$b_{i} = b_{i - n}$$$. For example, if $$$a = [2, 3, 1, 4]$$$ and $$$k = 3$$$, then $$$b = [2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4]$$$. Given a number $$$x$$$, it is required to count the number of such positions $$$l$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le n \\cdot k$$$), for which there exists a position $$$r \\ge l$$$, such that the sum of the elements of array $$$b$$$ on the segment $$$[l, r]$$$ is at least $$$x$$$ (in other words, $$$b_{l} + b_{l+1} + \\dots + b_{r} \\ge x$$$).",
  "inputFormat": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 10^{5}$$$; $$$1 \\le x \\le 10^{18}$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{i}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{i} \\le 10^{8}$$$). Additional constraints on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$; the sum of $$$k$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output one integer — the number of suitable positions $$$l$$$ in the array $$$b$$$.",
