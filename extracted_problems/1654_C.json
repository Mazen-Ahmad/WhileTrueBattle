  "statement": "Alice has a cake, and she is going to cut it. She will perform the following operation $$$n-1$$$ times: choose a piece of the cake (initially, the cake is all one piece) with weight $$$w\\ge 2$$$ and cut it into two smaller pieces of weight $$$\\lfloor\\frac{w}{2}\\rfloor$$$ and $$$\\lceil\\frac{w}{2}\\rceil$$$ ($$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ and $$$\\lceil x \\rceil$$$ denote floor and ceiling functions , respectively). After cutting the cake in $$$n$$$ pieces, she will line up these $$$n$$$ pieces on a table in an arbitrary order. Let $$$a_i$$$ be the weight of the $$$i$$$-th piece in the line. You are given the array $$$a$$$. Determine whether there exists an initial weight and sequence of operations which results in $$$a$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single line: print YES if the array $$$a$$$ could have resulted from Alice's operations, otherwise print NO . You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES , Yes , yes , yEs will all be recognized as positive answer).",
