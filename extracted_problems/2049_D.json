  "statement": "After having fun with a certain contraption and getting caught, Evirir the dragon decides to put their magical skills to good use — warping reality to escape fast! You are given a grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns of non-negative integers and an integer $$$k$$$. Let $$$(i, j)$$$ denote the cell in the $$$i$$$-th row from the top and $$$j$$$-th column from the left ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$). For every cell $$$(i, j)$$$, the integer $$$a_{i, j}$$$ is written on the cell $$$(i, j)$$$. You are initially at $$$(1, 1)$$$ and want to go to $$$(n, m)$$$. You may only move down or right. That is, if you are at $$$(i, j)$$$, you can only move to $$$(i+1, j)$$$ or $$$(i, j+1)$$$ (if the corresponding cell exists). Before you begin moving, you may do the following operation any number of times: Choose an integer $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ and cyclically shift row $$$i$$$ to the left by $$$1$$$. Formally, simultaneously set $$$a_{i,j}$$$ to $$$a_{i,(j \\bmod m) + 1}$$$ for all integers $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$). Note that you may not do any operation after you start moving. After moving from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(n, m)$$$, let $$$x$$$ be the number of operations you have performed before moving, and let $$$y$$$ be the sum of the integers written on visited cells (including $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(n, m)$$$). Then the cost is defined as $$$kx + y$$$. Find the minimum cost to move from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(n, m)$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains three space-separated integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 200$$$, $$$0 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$$$). Then, $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$m$$$ space-separated integers, $$$a_{i,1},\\,a_{i,2},\\,\\ldots,\\,a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_{i,j} \\leq 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^4$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer, the minimum cost to move from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(n, m)$$$.",
