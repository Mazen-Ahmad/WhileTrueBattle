  "statement": "For given integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, let's call a pair of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of integers good , if they satisfy the following conditions: $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length, let their length be $$$k$$$. $$$k \\ge 2$$$ and $$$a_1 = 0, a_k = n, b_1 = 0, b_k = m$$$. For each $$$1 < i \\le k$$$ the following holds: $$$a_i \\geq a_{i - 1}$$$, $$$b_i \\geq b_{i - 1}$$$, and $$$a_i + b_i \\neq a_{i - 1} + b_{i - 1}$$$. Find the sum of $$$|a|$$$ over all good pairs of arrays $$$(a,b)$$$. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t (1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n, m \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^6)$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^6$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^6$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of $$$|a|$$$ over all good pairs of arrays $$$(a,b)$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
