  "statement": "Firefly is given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Let $$$c_i$$$ denote the $$$i$$$'th cyclic shift$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$a$$$. She creates a new array $$$b$$$ such that $$$b = c_1 + c_2 + \\dots + c_n$$$ where $$$+$$$ represents concatenation$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$. Then, she asks you $$$q$$$ queries. For each query, output the sum of all elements in the subarray of $$$b$$$ that starts from the $$$l$$$-th element and ends at the $$$r$$$-th element, inclusive of both ends. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The $$$x$$$-th ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq n$$$) cyclic shift of the array $$$a$$$ is $$$a_x, a_{x+1} \\ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \\ldots a_{x - 1}$$$. Note that the $$$1$$$-st shift is the initial $$$a$$$. $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$The concatenation of two arrays $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ of length $$$n$$$ (in other words, $$$p + q$$$) is $$$p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, q_1, q_2, ..., q_n$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array and the number of queries. The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^6$$$). The following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n^2$$$) — the left and right bounds of the query. Note that the large inputs may require the use of 64-bit integers. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
