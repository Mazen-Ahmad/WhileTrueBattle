  "statement": "You have given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$x$$$ to a brand new robot. What the robot does is the following: it iterates over the elements of the array, let the current element be $$$q$$$. If $$$q$$$ is divisible by $$$x$$$, the robot adds $$$x$$$ copies of the integer $$$\\frac{q}{x}$$$ to the end of the array, and moves on to the next element. Note that the newly added elements could be processed by the robot later. Otherwise, if $$$q$$$ is not divisible by $$$x$$$, the robot shuts down. Please determine the sum of all values of the array at the end of the process.",
  "inputFormat": "The first input line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the value which is used by the robot. The next line contains integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the initial values in the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output one integer — the sum of all elements at the end of the process.",
