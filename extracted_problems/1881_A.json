  "statement": "Given a string $$$x$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$m$$$ ($$$n \\cdot m \\le 25$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters, you can apply any number of operations to the string $$$x$$$. In one operation, you append the current value of $$$x$$$ to the end of the string $$$x$$$. Note that the value of $$$x$$$ will change after this. For example, if $$$x =$$$\" aba \", then after applying operations, $$$x$$$ will change as follows: \" aba \" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \" abaaba \" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \" abaabaabaaba \". After what minimum number of operations $$$s$$$ will appear in $$$x$$$ as a substring? A substring of a string is defined as a contiguous segment of it.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\cdot m \\le 25$$$) — the lengths of strings $$$x$$$ and $$$s$$$, respectively. The second line of each test case contains the string $$$x$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The third line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$m$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a single number — the minimum number of operations after which $$$s$$$ will appear in $$$x$$$ as a substring. If this is not possible, output $$$-1$$$.",
