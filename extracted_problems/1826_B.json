  "statement": "You have an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. Let's define $$$f(a, x) = [a_1 \\bmod x, a_2 \\bmod x, \\dots, a_n \\bmod x]$$$ for some positive integer $$$x$$$. Find the biggest $$$x$$$, such that $$$f(a, x)$$$ is a palindrome. Here, $$$a \\bmod x$$$ is the remainder of the integer division of $$$a$$$ by $$$x$$$. An array is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. More formally, an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is a palindrome if for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) $$$a_i = a_{n - i + 1}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). It's guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output the biggest $$$x$$$, such that $$$f(a, x)$$$ is a palindrome. If $$$x$$$ can be infinitely large, output $$$0$$$ instead.",
