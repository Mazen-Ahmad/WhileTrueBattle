  "statement": "Stack has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He also has an empty set $$$S$$$. Note that $$$S$$$ is not a multiset. He will do the following three-step operation exactly $$$n$$$ times: Select an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq i \\leq |a|$$$. Insert$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$a_i + i$$$ into $$$S$$$. Delete $$$a_i$$$ from $$$a$$$. Note that the indices of all elements to the right of $$$a_i$$$ will decrease by $$$1$$$. Note that after $$$n$$$ operations, $$$a$$$ will be empty. Stack will now construct a new array $$$b$$$ which is $$$S$$$ sorted in decreasing order . Formally, $$$b$$$ is an array of size $$$|S|$$$ where $$$b_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th largest element of $$$S$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq |S|$$$. Find the lexicographically largest$$$^\\ddagger$$$ $$$b$$$ that Stack can make. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is already present in a set will not change the elements of the set. $$$^\\ddagger$$$ An array $$$p$$$ is lexicographically larger than a sequence $$$q$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$q$$$ is a prefix of $$$p$$$, but $$$p \\ne q$$$; or in the first position where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ differ, the array $$$p$$$ has a larger element than the corresponding element in $$$q$$$. Note that $$$[3,1,4,1,5]$$$ is lexicographically larger than $$$[3,1,3]$$$, $$$[\\,]$$$, and $$$[3,1,4,1]$$$ but not $$$[3,1,4,1,5,9]$$$, $$$[3,1,4,1,5]$$$, and $$$[4]$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the lexicographically largest $$$b$$$.",
