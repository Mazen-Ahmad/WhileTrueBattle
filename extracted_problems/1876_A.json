  "statement": "Pak Chanek is the chief of a village named Khuntien. On one night filled with lights, Pak Chanek has a sudden and important announcement that needs to be notified to all of the $$$n$$$ residents in Khuntien. First, Pak Chanek shares the announcement directly to one or more residents with a cost of $$$p$$$ for each person. After that, the residents can share the announcement to other residents using a magical helmet-shaped device. However, there is a cost for using the helmet-shaped device. For each $$$i$$$, if the $$$i$$$-th resident has got the announcement at least once (either directly from Pak Chanek or from another resident), he/she can share the announcement to at most $$$a_i$$$ other residents with a cost of $$$b_i$$$ for each share . If Pak Chanek can also control how the residents share the announcement to other residents, what is the minimum cost for Pak Chanek to notify all $$$n$$$ residents of Khuntien about the announcement?",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case. The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\leq p \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of residents and the cost for Pak Chanek to share the announcement directly to one resident. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq10^5$$$) — the maximum number of residents that each resident can share the announcement to. The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,b_3,\\ldots,b_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq b_i\\leq10^5$$$) — the cost for each resident to share the announcement to one other resident. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output a line containing an integer representing the minimum cost to notify all $$$n$$$ residents of Khuntien about the announcement.",
