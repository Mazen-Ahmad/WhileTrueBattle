  "statement": "You have an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of non-zero integers. Initially, you have $$$0$$$ coins, and you will do the following until $$$a$$$ is empty: Let $$$m$$$ be the current size of $$$a$$$. Select an integer $$$i$$$ where $$$1 \\le i \\le m$$$, gain $$$|a_i|$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ coins, and then: if $$$a_i < 0$$$, then replace $$$a$$$ with $$$[a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{i - 1}]$$$ (that is, delete the suffix beginning with $$$a_i$$$); otherwise, replace $$$a$$$ with $$$[a_{i + 1},a_{i + 2},\\ldots,a_m]$$$ (that is, delete the prefix ending with $$$a_i$$$). Find the maximum number of coins you can have at the end of the process. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$Here $$$|a_i|$$$ represents the absolute value of $$$a_i$$$: it equals $$$a_i$$$ when $$$a_i > 0$$$ and $$$-a_i$$$ when $$$a_i < 0$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$. The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$, $$$a_i \\ne 0$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ across all testcases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the maximum number of coins you can have at the end of the process.",
