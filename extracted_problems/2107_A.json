  "statement": "You have an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ — $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n$$$. You need to divide the $$$n$$$ elements into $$$2$$$ sequences $$$B$$$ and $$$C$$$, satisfying the following conditions: Each element belongs to exactly one sequence. Both sequences $$$B$$$ and $$$C$$$ contain at least one element. $$$\\gcd$$$ $$$(B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_{|B|}) \\ne \\gcd(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_{|C|})$$$ $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^4$$$).",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, first output $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$ if a solution exists or $$$\\texttt{No}$$$ if no solution exists. You may print each character in either case, for example $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{yEs}$$$ will also be accepted. Only when there is a solution, output $$$n$$$ integers on the second line. The $$$i$$$-th number should be either $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$. $$$1$$$ represents that the element belongs to sequence $$$B$$$ and $$$2$$$ represents that the element belongs to sequence $$$C$$$. You should guarantee that $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ both appear at least once.",
