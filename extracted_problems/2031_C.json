  "statement": "Penchick loves two things: square numbers and Hong Kong-style BBQ buns! For his birthday, Kohane wants to combine them with a gift: $$$n$$$ BBQ buns arranged from left to right. There are $$$10^6$$$ available fillings of BBQ buns, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$10^6$$$. To ensure that Penchick would love this gift, Kohane has a few goals: No filling is used exactly once; that is, each filling must either not appear at all or appear at least twice. For any two buns $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ that have the same filling, the distance between them, which is $$$|i-j|$$$, must be a perfect square$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. Help Kohane find a valid way to choose the filling of the buns, or determine if it is impossible to satisfy her goals! If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A positive integer $$$x$$$ is a perfect square if there exists a positive integer $$$y$$$ such that $$$x = y^2$$$. For example, $$$49$$$ and $$$1$$$ are perfect squares because $$$49 = 7^2$$$ and $$$1 = 1^2$$$ respectively. On the other hand, $$$5$$$ is not a perfect square as no integer squared equals $$$5$$$",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of BBQ buns. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, if no valid choice of fillings exists, output $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th integer represents the filling of the $$$i$$$-th BBQ bun. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
