  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$k = 0$$$. There is an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You should divide it into a minimal number of continuous segments, such that in each segment there are no two numbers (on different positions), whose product is a perfect square. Moreover, it is allowed to do at most $$$k$$$ such operations before the division: choose a number in the array and change its value to any positive integer. But in this version $$$k = 0$$$, so it is not important. What is the minimum number of continuous segments you should use if you will make changes optimally?",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\le t \\le 1000)$$$ — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$k = 0$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^7$$$). It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case print a single integer — the answer to the problem.",
