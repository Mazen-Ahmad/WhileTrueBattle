  "statement": "Given an integer $$$n$$$. Construct a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that satisfies the following property: For $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, define $$$c_i = \\lceil \\frac{p_1+p_2+\\ldots +p_i}{i} \\rceil$$$, then among $$$c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_n$$$ there must be at least $$$\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor - 1$$$ prime numbers.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. In a single line of each test case, there is a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5)$$$ — the size of the permutation.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, output the permutation $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that satisfies the condition. It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists.",
