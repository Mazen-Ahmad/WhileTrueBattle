  "statement": "You are given a binary$$$^\\dagger$$$ pattern $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. A binary string $$$q$$$ of the same length $$$n$$$ is called good if for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$), there exist indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that: $$$1 \\leq l \\leq i \\leq r \\leq n$$$, and $$$p_i$$$ is a mode$$$^\\ddagger$$$ of the string $$$q_lq_{l+1}\\ldots q_r$$$. Count the number of good binary strings modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$. $$$^\\dagger$$$ A binary string is a string that only consists of characters $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$. $$$^\\ddagger$$$ Character $$$c$$$ is a mode of string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$ if the number of occurrences of $$$c$$$ in $$$t$$$ is at least $$$\\lceil \\frac{m}{2} \\rceil$$$. For example, $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ is a mode of $$$\\mathtt{010}$$$, $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ is not a mode of $$$\\mathtt{010}$$$, and both $$$\\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ are modes of $$$\\mathtt{011010}$$$.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) â€” the length of the binary string $$$p$$$. The second line of input contains a binary string $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters 0 and 1 .",
