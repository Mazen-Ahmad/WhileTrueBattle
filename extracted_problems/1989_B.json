  "statement": "You are given two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both consisting of lowercase Latin letters. A subsequence of a string is a string which can be obtained by removing several (possibly zero) characters from the original string. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. For example, consider the string abac : a , b , c , ab , aa , ac , ba , bc , aba , abc , aac , bac and abac are its subsequences; a , b , c , ab , ba , ac , aba , bac and abac are its substrings. Your task is to calculate the minimum possible length of the string that contains $$$a$$$ as a substring and $$$b$$$ as a subsequence.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a string $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \\le |a| \\le 100$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le |b| \\le 100$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible length of the string that contains $$$a$$$ as a substring and $$$b$$$ as a subsequence.",
