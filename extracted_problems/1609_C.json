  "statement": "While performing complex market analysis William encountered the following problem: For a given array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ and a natural number $$$e$$$, calculate the number of pairs of natural numbers $$$(i, k)$$$ which satisfy the following conditions: $$$1 \\le i, k$$$ $$$i + e \\cdot k \\le n$$$. Product $$$a_i \\cdot a_{i + e} \\cdot a_{i + 2 \\cdot e} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot a_{i + k \\cdot e} $$$ is a prime number. A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.",
  "inputFormat": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10\\,000$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$e$$$ $$$(1 \\le e \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$$$, the number of items in the array and number $$$e$$$, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6)$$$, the contents of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case output the answer in the following format: Output one line containing the number of pairs of numbers $$$(i, k)$$$ which satisfy the conditions.",
